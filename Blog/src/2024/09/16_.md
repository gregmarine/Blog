# TBD

The trash valet did not pick up my trash last night...hehehe Pickup nights are Sunday through Thursday. Sometimes they miss due to weather. Last night, there were no weather events...LOL When I saw the trash bag in my bin this morning, I grabbed it and walked it across the entire complex over to where the trash compactor is. As I was on my way, it was tempting to be a little upset. After all, I am required to pay for this service that I did not receive. Also, the valet company is always complaining about the tenants and we get emails weekly about it. I quickly dismissed my personal feelings, though. I realize that my life could come to an end today. Did it really matter that my trash wasn't picked up last night? Not one bit! Also, it was a great reminder of how God has healed my body. At the beginning of 2023, I wasn't physically capable of carrying a bag of trash that far. It's true! It was a simple reminder of how God has healed. Yet, it still makes a huge impact on my heart.

Today's *The Chosen* devotional helped put this into perspective. I'm grateful I did today's lesson before encountering the lack of service from the trash valet...hehehe The parable mentioned today was the one with the farmer who had an abundant crop. He stored it all up and declared he would eat, drink, and be merry on the *wealth* he had amassed. Then God called him a fool and told him his life would be demanded of him that very night. So, who was going to enjoy or inherit this abundant crop after all?!?

I feel as though this lesson applies to more than just possessions. I can apply this same lesson to all circumstances. Including the trivial trash fail from last night...LOL You see, letting go of the simple means my heart remains soft. Those simple things can add up over time. If I allow my heart to be hardened by the simple issues of life, I'll amass an abundance of resentment that will eventually cause me to become angry over the bigger picture stuff. But what good would that be if my life was demanded of me today and my heart wasn't prepared for His Kingdom?

Of course, the parable itself was about being rich in God instead of *earthly possessions*. That doesn't escape me. That was indeed the context of the passage. However, for someone who has literally had to restart his life several times, I must look for other ways to apply such a lesson. Life itself taught me that my possessions are meaningless in the big picture. I've lost everything multiple times. But I also feel that all of the lessons of the Bible can be applied to almost any circumstance anyway. That's one of the many fascinating aspects of the Bible being the living Word of God. I believe it literally applies to everything in my life. Today's lesson reminded me to store up goodness in my heart. That goodness is one of the many things that will make me rich in God.

Every work day, I check a system called *Service Now* to see if there are any requests I should be working on immediately for people who are having issues or requests with the systems I'm responsible for. Today, a few tickets came through. One of them looked pretty simple. Shortly after I claimed the ticket for my pile of tasks, one of my teammates reached out to me to ask some questions about the same system. As it turned out, they were working on the request already...LOL

As he was asking me questions, I mentioned I was going to be working on it. But I was happy to help him with his questions. After some speculation, I mentioned we should just get the end user on the phone to get a clearer understanding of what they needed done. That was a good idea! Within a few minutes of conversation, it was clear what was needed. My teammate might have been spinning his wheels on this for a while had he not reached out. It was by accident that he even looked into it in the first place. It was my responsibility anyway. I just had no idea he even had it on his *radar*...LOL I'm glad we were able to get it taken care of quickly and that his time wasn't wasted...hehehe

So, today was my first attempt at doing a full one mile morning prayer walk on a work day. It went really well. I didn't feel rushed. And I was finished well before I planned to begin working today. I already loved doing a third of a mile most days. Doing a full mile really feels great. Plus it means I'll get in additional walking everyday. What I was doing before was do the one lap in the morning. Then I'd walk two laps at lunch to get in a total of a full mile by mid-day. I often walk two more miles after dinner. Now, I can walk one mile before work, I have plenty of time at lunch to do a full mile as well, and I can still walk two miles after dinner. It's a great time of reflection and prayer.
