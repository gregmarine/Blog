Good morning! Happy Monday!!!

I'm really excited for this week! I expect productivity at work to continue. And I'll be spending part of the week preparing for my California trip! Next Monday through Thursday, I'll be working from the little apartment I'm renting. But Sunday and Friday I'll be at Disneyland!!! The following Saturday will be a day of rest before I travel back home that Sunday. I also have the day off on November 11th for Veteran's Day. I'm not sure what I'll do that day just yet...hehehe

I didn't journal yesterday. I had a really good momentum going last week. But yesterday, I didn't get around to doing it. Throughout the day, my path didn't bring me to the keyboard to write here. And by the time I settled in the evening, I decided I didn't want to sit at the computer. When I woke this morning, I just felt like going back to it...hehehe

I did not end up having lunch with Valerie yesterday. As I've stated before, I'm grateful for the brief time our journey's crossed. I had hoped a friendship would happen. I hope I added to her life the times we took those walks. I know she added to mine through her stories. And I've been praying for her. So, taking thoughts of her to the Lord has been a blessing.

It was strange that I wasn't disappointed in not having lunch with her yesterday. I extended the invitation on Tuesday and she seemed quite excited about it. She even suggested we have a seafood meal at a seaside restaurant. It was to be a farewell meal as she is moving next week. But on Wednesday, she wanted to change it to having a pizza at the pool...hehehe By the time our walk was over that day, it became more of a *we'll see how she feels on Sunday*. When it didn't happen yesterday, I was already prepared. I had set my expectations with her on Tuesday, and she decided not to accept those expectations by Wednesday...hehehe The growth I've experienced this year enabled me to realize that it's okay when things do not work out quite like we expect or hope. But with the right heart posture, things work out better than we expect or hope for. God is always working out things for our good and for His Glory. And I have peace about things not working out for our friendship.

In my Bible study notes from last week, I briefly described a weekly tradition at my parents' house. I decided I wanted to talk about it here today too. Last week's lesson was about the sabbath. Growing up, we went to church and had a sort of family day at home. Nothing too special. But it remains special in my heart because it was *my* childhood...hehehe

Once we all moved out of our parents' house, got married, and had children, our parents decided to host a weekly family lunch after church for whomever could make it each week. They would prepare the meal and we would all sit around this large farmhouse table. It was one of those tables that could extend or shrink depending on how many would be sitting around it. My brother and his family still have this lunch with our parents most Sundays. My sister and I now live in Florida and rarely get to participate.

I hope to enjoy this lunch with them all on my next visit. I originally planned to go up for a week. I'm now tempted to be there for two weeks...hehehe Cherie and I were talking about Thanksgiving week on our call yesterday. It prompted a thought that I may go to Indiana for Thanksgiving this year. At this point, it is merely a thought. But it would be the first time in about six years that I will have been in Indiana for Thanksgiving...LOL I stopped doing Thanksgiving years ago. Long story short, there were family issues with my in-laws back then that inspired being in Florida each year for Thanksgiving...hehehe

I miss Thanksgiving and Christmas with my extended family. They all still gather to this day...well, those who still live near grandma. I haven't been a part of those gatherings for years. My last marriage really did some damage...hehehe Damage I've already healed from and I'm ready to get back to former traditions I enjoyed. Although the fallout from my bad marriages isn't over in some hearts, it is for mine. Who knows, perhaps my being there will help heal those other hearts? There's a thought I should consider!

These are just thoughts for now. Being away from home for two weeks will not be easy. My life is in Florida now...at least for now. But I do think I'm at a point in my personal growth that will afford me the opportunity to spend two weeks in Indiana this year without fully disrupting my health. Food-wise, I could see if mom will allow me to make my own food. Sleep-wise, I do sleep well there. Exercise is still possible as I can take plenty of walks. And now that I'm sort of going with the flow instead of being set to a solid routine, I think I can manage to accept whatever schedule or routine I need to do to accept come what may for two weeks up there...hehehe

The main point I'm making is that for the first time in years, I'm very much looking forward to having time in Indiana...hehehe
