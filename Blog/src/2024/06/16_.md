# TBD

Happy Father's Day! I think this is the second Father's Day I wasn't with my father or son. Last year, I went to Disney World...hehehe This year, I'm at home. When I first moved to Florida, I traveled to Indiana every month. I'm certain my June trip was Father's Day weekend that year. So I was able to spend that year's holiday with them. One of my church friends mentioned this morning some statistic that this holiday was ranked 15th in how much importance people put in a holiday. Christmas ranked #1, of course. I think Mother's Day was #2?

I feel slightly disconnected from this holiday myself. Although I'd classify my father as a *good dad*, we never really connected in a way that made me feel close to him. We have similar interests and all. But his personality and lack of connection with others outside of the intellectual somewhat pushed me away as a kid. And we never really connected as adults either. I'm not complaining. Just stating a fact. As a father myself, I have felt disconnected from my own son since he was 4. I've been there for him as best I can with our situation. I'm making the most of it. Again, not complaining and simply stating a fact that I feel disconnected.

I only attended 2 church services this today...hehehe Of course, both sermons were about being a father...LOL Both messages were a reminder that I am not a Biblical father. That makes me a bit sad, really. But I also find joy in how I've made the most of what I was able to be considering the circumstances. I decided not to try that 3rd church this weekend because I figure it was going to be another sermon on being a father...hehehe

I was reminded today that I really did give it my best for my son and the 2 stepsons I had for a brief time. I was reminded that, although I had no control over the circumstances that divide us, I did all that I could with what I had when I was able. Yes, part of my move to Florida came with it a sense of *giving up*. But on the flip side, I knew things were only going to get worse had I stayed in Indiana.
