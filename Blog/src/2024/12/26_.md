## 07:45am

I'm surprised I'm functioning as well as I am this morning...LOL Yesterday, I went all day on 5 hours sleep...LOL I went to bed early on Christmas Eve knowing I'd want to wake early yesterday. I did wake early. But much earlier than I had planned. I was able to get ready for my day, while doing my normal routine, without rushing. And when I was ready, I actually had time to relax before hitting the road.

I went to Disney yesterday. I'm thinking about doing a second journal entry today just for that. I didn't get around to journaling about Thanksgiving. But I would like to document my Christmas. Especially since it was my first Disney Christmas. With Thanksgiving, I have done Disney several times now...hehehe

But just in case I don't journal that experience, I'll go ahead and mention that I arrived at the TTC (Magic Kingdom parking lot) around 7:30am. I went all day and didn't leave the TTC to head home until around 9:30pm. I did 3 of the 4 WDW theme parks. And it was pretty much non-stop all day. The exceptions were the hour for lunch and the hour for the Candlelight Processional. That's 14 hours of go go go after only 5 hours sleep...LOL

Yet, here I am, functioning today after a typical night sleep...hehehe Just goes to show you how God has been healing my body, soul, and mind these past few years. I actually had enough energy to keep going last night. But I knew I had to work today...LOL

God is good! His loving kindness endures forever. AMEN!
