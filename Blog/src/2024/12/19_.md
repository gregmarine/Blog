Another day to thank the Lord. Every day is a gift. Every sleep is God renewing my body for another day. My gratitude continues to grow.

Last night I was blessed with a precious gift. This was on top of the gift my friendship with Cherie already is. She expressed the friendship further through a poem she has written for me. It is published through The Unsealed community. You can read [Garden of Memories](https://theunsealed.com/activity/p/25379/) to see for yourself. I'm grateful for the friendship that inspired the words. We continue to plant seeds and water the garden of this friendship. And God is the One who makes it grow. It's a beautiful garden that I cherish very much. Tending to this garden with my deer friend has been one of the most best experiences of my life.
