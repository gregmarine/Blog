Good morning! And welcome to another day with meeeeeee! LOL (in Budford's voice, of course...hehehe)

I slept well last night. With the exception of one trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I didn't wake until my white noise turned off. I probably could have slept longer had I set that to go longer. But that's perfectly fine. I feel really well this morning.

I'm looking forward to the new day. Besides work, I really don't know what is in store today. That's the case most days lately. Without a specific routine and a *what are we going to do today* focus, I have no expectations for my days right now...hehehe

It's okay to not be comfortable all the time. Oftentimes, growth comes from discomfort. And as we grow, there will be pain.

I recall how bad growing pains were when I was physically growing. That wasn't fun at all...LOL Now, years later, I still experience growing pains. They just aren't physical anymore. Well, some are...hehehe Sometimes the mental and spiritual pain of growing can manifest itself into physical aches and pains. But the point is that the pain I feel sometimes is a good sign of spiritual and mental growth.

This has been an encouraging thought this morning. This has been a year of growth. With that, came a lot of pain. I've said that last year was the most difficult year of my life. That was because I finally faced my past head on and began doing something about it. This year, has been quite a bit more painful. But I look at this year as the best year of my life.

My personal growth this year has afforded me a perspective on my circumstances that has given me peace. Not peace I've created by making changes that bring me comfort. The peace I speak of can only come from God. I've stepped out of my comfort zone and put my trust and hope in Him. It's the kind of trust I haven't had since I was a child and I trusted my parents with my life. Now, I've returned to that kind of faith when it comes to my Father in Heaven.

I'm not comfortable right now. I'm in a lot of *soul pain*. I'm rejoicing for the transformation God is doing in my heart. He is my comfort <3
