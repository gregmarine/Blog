## Food for Thought

In part 3 of [Food for Thought](../03/31_my-path-food-for-thought-and-love#food-for-thought), I talked about some negative attachments I've had to people, places, and things from my life in the mid-west.

A week ago on Good Friday, my employer allowed us all to leave work around 1pm for an early dismal to celebrate the Easter weekend. I honestly wasn't expecting it and it was a very welcome surprise. With the extra 4 hours I was gifted, I decided to visit the *Nature Coast Botanical Gardens* in Spring Hill, Florida.

One of my favorite moments from that experience was the red-bellied woodpecker in the above photograph. I spent about 5 minutes enjoying this beautiful creation working on building some homes in the tree. I took several photographs by which to remember the moment through. As I was reviewing them this morning, I was inspired to write the haiku.

I cherish moments like these. It was simple. It was beautiful. And God has given me the ability to capture such moments through a lens. In this particular photograph, I shot through some leaves in the foreground. It was as if I was peering through into a secret place and watching God provide just what this creature needed to sustain its existence.

In my daily morning prayers, I first recite the Lord's Prayer from Matthew 6:9-15 in the Amplified Version (verses 14 & 15 are quite important). But after I do that, I then speak verses 9-13 in my own words. In regards to *daily bread*, I thank God for all the food and drink He provides to sustain me physically. I follow that up with thanking Him for the prayer and scripture that sustain me both mentally and spiritually. When I look at this woodpecker, or any other wildlife for that matter, I can't help but stand in awe of all that God provides.
