# TBD

I'm *home*.

The *transition* back to my *normal* has been smooth. I suppose, preparing for the time zone difference in California was a wise decision...hehehe I've already had people comment on how surprised they are that I'm functioning today. I'm not experiencing jet lag whatsoever today. I didn't even rush to get to my coffee this morning. I think I may have even had it later than I usually do...hehehe Again, that's because I don't drink it for the caffeine anyway. It is more of a grounding mechanism for me. One that I'm considering letting go of.

I'm already continuing my reflection from my trip. Part of what God was talking to me about on the trip was how I treasure my friends and family and whether I could give any of them up or not for the sake of following Jesus. Clearly, He isn't asking me to give any of them up. But what I do sense is that He wants me to let go of the importance I put on those relationships. To be clear, I'm not talking about letting go of their value.
