## Birth Month

Happy March!!! And Happy Birthday month to meeeee!!!! hehehe

Historically, I haven't celebrated my birthday for an entire month. It really isn't in my personality to celebrate myself at all. Last year, I pretty much gave myself a break and celebrated most of March. It was fun-ish...hehehe I even invited anyone who was interested in celebrating with me at Disney World last year the week of my birthday. A total of 8 people came throughout that visit. It was nice.

I originally planned to be in California for my birthday this year. I wanted to celebrate at Disneyland and visit with family and friends. That did not work out. That's okay. I'll get to California eventually. Hopefully later this year after all of the work stuff settles down.

So, what am I going to do for my birthday this year? I'm not sure. Possibly nothing...LOL Last year was an experiment. Should I experiment again this year? Probably not. I'm finding happiness in my every day life now. I really don't need to chase after big moments anymore. Last year taught me quite a bit about living in the moment. I chased after big moments last year. It was not worth it for me.

This year's birthday isn't a milestone of any kind. Last year, it was my 45th. With it being my 46th this year, I'll most likely just celebrate internally the fact that I'm here for another year and that I'm happier and healthier than a year ago.
