# TBD

Well, September isn't going quite like I had expected earlier this year. Although it is different than expected, it isn't any better or worse than I envisioned. Part of that is my new (to me) philosophy of expecting nothing while appreciating everything. I may have ideas and thoughts about what I'd like to do in any given time frame or season. But I look at it with hope without disappointment. Hope for the best while not being disappointed if reality falls a little short of the hope...hehehe

I traveled in June, July, and August. The year I moved to Florida, I traveled 13 times. Basically one trip just past traveling every month. That extra trip was due to a hurricane...hehehe Last year, I traveled just twice. After getting past the initial uncertainty about my job's transition, I decided I wanted to travel more this year. I started to feel like going back to the once per month cadence. Unlike 2022, I wanted to travel to other places besides back to my home in Indiana. In June, my trip was in Indiana. July it was California and August was North Carolina.

Yes, I'm saying nothing new. I've been talking about that a lot. Well, I really wanted to travel again in September. My original plans were for California again. When those plans weren't working out, I set my sights on Texas. But then I received a summons for jury duty the week I wanted to travel...LOL It became clear that God might have wanted me to remain at home this month. I'm completely fine with that. I was a bit sad I wouldn't be seeing friends I wanted to travel to see. But I also know that whatever God had in store for the month, it was going to be better in some way.

If the Lord wills it, I think I'd still like to do some sort of travel this month. Instead of a place I would need to fly to, perhaps I could find somewhere within driving distance? Louisiana, Alabama, or somewhere else here in Florida would be nice. But as I dream of going somewhere, I also recognize what the problem is...hehehe

So, what's my problem? I haven't been able to focus while at home. I do my day job and all basic tasks each week. But when I go to sit and focus on a personal project, I get very distracted...LOL When I travel, I tend to find some focus. This seems weird to me. I have no idea if anyone else experiences this or not. I was talking with someone the other day about it and they mentioned they experience something similar.

This leads me back to thinking perhaps I should just stay at home for a while. Rather than escaping home to find focus, maybe I should figure out how to be focused while at home...hehehe Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I'm actively thinking this through. Can you tell by this journal entry?!? LOL

One thought I've had on this subject is to simply be present in my community without traveling. I could go to a park, bar, or coffee shop. I did that last Saturday and Monday so I could write. The problem with that is that I tend to spend money when I do that. I always feel guilty taking up a seat while I work. So I get food and drinks to justify my presence...hehehe

Honestly, though, I don't think they really care. At places with a bar, I'm only taking up one seat as opposed to entire table. That's actually why I love bars. I don't always drink when I'm at a bar anyway. I've learned the delight of a glass of water, no ice, with a lemon and lime...hehehe It's refreshing and has no alcohol. Although it does feel weird to be the only one sitting at the bar not drinking...LOL Guess what, I don't care...LOL

But back to enjoying my local community while being able to focus on my *work*. Yeah, instead of traveling, I could do more local exploration and sit with my MacBook to focus. And I don't actually need to spend a lot of money to do so. I could get a meal. But I really don't think the bartender cares that I take up a single seat for hours while only have a meal or snack. I don't need to feel guilty about it. When I do sit for hours working on my projects, I see a good turnaround of folks coming and going. These places aren't hurting when I take up that one seat...hehehe I need to stop feeling guilty about it.

Speaking of plans that didn't work out for September, this past Tuesday would have been the first Dodgers game I would have gone to. Cherie and I talked about going to that game months ago. It didn't work out for this season. And that is absolutely okay. I wasn't able to watch the game on TV but did follow along through the MLB and Apple apps. It looked like a fantastic game.

Today, I watched the condensed game on the MLB app. Wow! That was an amazing game. It made my heart so happy to watch the highlight reel. I was imagining Cherie and I in the grandstands...hehehe It was like I could wave at the screen and we'd be waving back...LOL When we do get to go to a game together, I'll see if we can actually do that. We may not actually end up on TV. But it will be fun pretending and then waving back at ourselves when we watch the replay...hehehe

I would have also gone to Disneyland this week. Something I find funny is that a few of my friends are there this week...LOL Mack and Meg went this week. I've actually avoided seeing their social media posts this week...hehehe I'll be going in November and didn't want any spoilers. Mack and Meg are recently dating. I've known them both for a little over a year now. I'm very happy for them. But I'm glad I didn't go this week. I wouldn't have wanted to take away from their experience since they are just starting off as a couple...hehehe
