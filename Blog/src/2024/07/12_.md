# TBD

This has been a rough week. I just wanted to get that out of the way. I needed to say that because the rest of this entry is likely going to sound like it wasn't a rough week...hehehe I feel as though I have been passing a series of tests as this week has unfolded. I feel joy in the circumstances I've faced because it feels like proof of what God has been doing in my life this year. I was able to apply some of the things I've learned through prayer and scripture. I would not have chosen to go through this week if given a choice. But I'm grateful for God's refinement of my heart in preparation for it.

Now with that out of the way...hehehe Work has been going really well overall. There were some stressful moments due to the continued transition of employees from the old company to the new one. And there was a production bug discovered yesterday in one of my systems that I accidentally created months ago. Thankfully I've navigated both well. For the bug, I was even able to identify the solution and implement said solution quickly. Crisis averted...LOL

I had a meeting today that was very encouraging. I was offered some new responsibilities that I gladly accepted. I even offered to take on a little more than what was being considered to help alleviate some of the stress my boss has been facing. He was happy to hear I could help out. This works out really well as I had been feeling a little underused of late. With the huge transition going on this year, my work load dropped. All of the top priorities on my plate were super easy to get through in preparation for the transition. Other lesser tasks were put on hold until this phase of the transition was completed this week. Now that it is pretty much complete, I'm ready for the next great thing...hehehe
