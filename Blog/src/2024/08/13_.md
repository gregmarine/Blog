## New Port Richey

On Friday, my sister reached out to me to see if I wanted to hang out with her on Saturday. Since I rarely see her, I made myself available. I had wanted to be out and about on that day anyway. Having someone come along was an added bonus...hehehe When I got to her place, she asked what I wanted to do. I was interested in doing a *downtown* sort of day. My first thought was downtown Dunedin where she lives. In the conversation I had mentioned downtown New Port Richey. She had never been. So I offered the suggestion we go there instead. So we did...hehehe

NPR is one of the few places near me that I have considered as a possible place to move to next year. It seemed like a great idea to check it out. I've been there a few times. My favorite Asian restaurant is there, actually. But besides that, I've only ever checked out the ice cream parlor. I hadn't ever just spent the day exploring it.
