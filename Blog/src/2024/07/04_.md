First, and foremost, Happiest of Birthdays to Ch√©rie! I know she reads this blog...hehehe So I wanted to say that to her, again, here...hehehe I can't wait to see her this weekend <3 It so surreal that I'm currently only a few miles from her right now. We live about 2000 miles apart. But my trip has closed that gap quite a bit...hehehe

People seem to know my hotel well. It appears it is a local chain. I hadn't heard of it before this trip. I chose it due to its proximity to the church. It's actually turned out to be an excellent choice in general. It's really nice. For the most part, it has been quite. I find it really easy to get to. When I adventure off away from the hotel, it has been really easy navigating back. Even coming in from the airport was super easy. The highway was backed up when I was coming in from the airport. But the exit I needed had a lane that was empty. So the traffic didn't bother me at all...LOL And the staff have been really friendly. There haven't been any spontaneous dance parties or random character meet & greets...hehehe But this isn't Disney...LOL

The views around here are amazing. I knew I loved the mountains. But it had been so long since I've been anywhere with mountains that I had forgotten just how much I loved them. Could I possible live in Diamond Bar someday?!? *Maybe*...hehehe Even with my stop in Las Vegas, what I loved seeing the most was the mountains. I could see a few of the famous hotels from the airport. But the mountains were where my eyes were drawn.

Well, today, I ended up on a mountain! Yay!!! I had no idea I would be *climbing* a mountain on this trip. I had absolutely no plans to do so and hadn't even given it a thought.
