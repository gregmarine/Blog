# No Words

There are no words strong enough for how I am feeling right now. The goodness of God I have been experiencing cannot be described. I often wonder if certain things were left out of the Bible for the very same reasons for how I feel right now. Some things seem to only be explainable in spiritual terms that have no words.

I sometimes try to write what I'm experiencing and how I am feeling. I suppose some of what I say and write is *good enough* to convey *something*. I've learned to accept that I cannot always translate what is in my soul in a way that would communicate it well to another person. Is that okay? I hope so. Is it that I feel I want to communicate, or do I feel everyone needs to know, how I feel? For now, there will be times when there simply are no words.

I'm back to work today. I've been off for the past four days. It feels good to be back at the job. There is a lot going on right now and I've been keeping busy. Last week was a great week of productivity that set me up to have a great week this week as well. I hope to accomplish quite a bit in the week to come.

I'm pondering my trip to Indiana. I plan to drive. So, I'll travel on the weekends as to not need to take time off work. I haven't decided if I'll be there for one week or two. With all that is going on with work, one week seems smart. But I may also be able to make it work out to be more productive if I remain up there for two. So many things to consider...hehehe

One thought I had was to rent a workspace or find some other place to go other than my parents' house while I work. Regardless where I work from, meetings are the hardest part. I don't have a good headset. The software we use for meetings doesn't handle headsets well. Everyone that uses any sort of headset or headphones seems to struggle on calls. I just use the laptop. But I always work from somewhere that allows me to do that. It's like a speakerphone setup. If I'm somewhere that I cannot do that, I simply do not do those meetings...LOL Or I put myself in *Do Not Disturb*...LOL Yeah, I cannot do that for two full weeks...LOL Perhaps I can use my phone for the voice part of the calls? Hmmm

I just got up from a nap. I've been taking a quick 15-20 minute nap a few times a week lately. I never realized the power of an afternoon nap...LOL Sure, I had naps as a child. Sure, I've fallen asleep while watching TV. But to intentionally take a nap as an adult now is a blessing...hehehe I don't track my naps like I do my nighttime sleep. I'm not sure my watch can track naps, actually. But I do recall having dreams this time. So, I must have dropped into REM a few moments. The fondest of the dreams was of Cherie and I dancing. My mind must of drawn from our actual dancing on Friday...hehehe That makes sense because I keep thinking about that day <3

It is difficult to choose my favorite moment that day. I had such a wonderful day overall. Even before Cherie arrived, I was having a blessed time. This is a odd moment to call blessed, but there was this one moment when a guy looked at my attire and made a rude comment about how he thought dapper day was the previous week. I kindly agreed that dapper day was the Sunday before and that I just enjoyed dressing up. It felt blessed because I didn't really react. I simply responded. For years, I lacked confidence due to trauma. It was so amazing to feel healed and to confidently state that I was simply doing something I enjoy. I felt no embarrassment and I didn't even take offense to his rudeness. I feel really good about that.

As this year draws to a close, I've been thinking about how I would like to continue this blog. I need to archive this year in some manner. I host the site myself using a platform designed for documentation. Each day I write, it has to recompile the entire site. Now that there are so many entries, the length of time it takes to compile the whole thing and the resources it takes to do it have grown. So, in the new year, I don't want the system to have to compile everything from this year too. Something I'm considering is actually moving to a third-party platform like Blogspot. I chose do the site myself because I'm a software engineer and it is fun to work behind the scenes. I don't have a hard requirement to host it myself, though. Either way, I'll be keeping a copy of this year's entries online somehow. I'll link to the archive from whatever I chose to do next year...hehehe

I just finished some required training for work. It is compliance training as the company is a servicer of student loans. From time to time we must do training. It isn't directly related to my job most of the time. But we all must do it. There have been a few that are specific to what I do. But those are rare.

The training system with this new company has taught me patience...hehehe The modules really do not give you an idea of how much is left. The slides are numbered. But you don't know if there will be a test until you get through the slides. And then once you do a test, you don't know if there is another module coming next. I think it shows you how many there will be when you first start. But as you go, there isn't a progress system to show you. Also, if you get any of the questions wrong on the test, you don't know what the correct answers are until you are completely finished with the whole thing. I'd prefer to know what I missed as I go along since it is fresh on my mind...hehehe

Anyway, the way those work has really helped with my patience. It has taught me that it's okay to not know what lies ahead sometimes. There are times when I know I must go through something no matter what. Not knowing what is happening next is okay because no matter what it is, I must face it anyway. Although it is great to prepare for what comes next, oftentimes all the preparation I think I need to do is futile because I don't actually know what to expect. If I trust that God has provided all I need when I need it, that's all I should focus on.

Funny how a required training module can get me thinking about that...LOL

Well, I finally got around to enrolling in my benefits for 2025. Open enrollment began last week while I was in California. I decided I would wait until I was home to go through it all. I basically went with what I already had and the health insurance part will cost me $11 more. But something else was reduced by $100...so I'm actually saving $89 per paycheck next year...LOL

I once had an employer who paid 100% of the premiums. I basically had free healthcare for about six years. I loved those bosses...hehehe Unfortunately, their generosity cost them in the end when the contract I was part of wasn't renewed. It was a huge contract worth millions, if I recall. They kept most of us on for as long as they could after that contract ended. But eventually, everyone was let go and only the two founding partners remained. I think they might still be in business? I hope so because they were a couple of great dudes!

I keep thinking about last week. I should probably journal about everything. I may have to do so in a private journal, though. Some of it is a *don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing* sort of thing. Wednesday, Friday, and both Sundays had such experiences. The one Friday happened while I was with Cherie. But she didn't even know it happened.

I think I should tell her about all of the things from the week, though. We are in fellowship and all that happened is a direct result of the devotionals and Bible study we have been doing most of the year. I've told her some of the amazing things that have happened this year and she has been a witness to at least one. My sharing with her would be boasting about what God is doing and not what I'm doing. I'm simply obeying. She knows this and I feel it is a safe conversation to share with her all that God has been doing through me. Especially last week.

I told her Friday that I couldn't tell her what all happened. I now realize she is one person I actually can. Maybe even Dan too. I'll want to do so privately. Maybe on video calls since neither of them live nearby...hehehe I suppose my hesitation on Friday with Cherie was that we were in public. I truly take *don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing* to heart. I never want anyone to feel like I'm boasting about something I'm doing. It was all God.
