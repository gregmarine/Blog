Sometimes, the answer to a prayer really hurts. Even when I expect the answer to be *no*, it can hurt when the hope is for a *yes*. I'll often hold on to my own thoughts of *I don't know*. But isn't that just denial? I can think to myself, *maybe I was wrong about the answer*. Rhetorically, I must ask myself, *didn't I already know the answer when I made my request known to God*? It isn't often that I don't believe God would answer in the affirmative. It is most likely that I don't believe I'm making the right request or that I'm even worthy of making it known before God.

Today is the fourth day in a row I failed to make an omelette worthy of that delicious name...LOL It was edible and it *looked* like an omelette. It just wasn't something I'd care to share with anyone...LOL I'm going to take a break from further attempts for a while. I'm no chef...nor do I have aspirations to be. I'll never be tested for my omelette skills...or egg preparation in general. Just because it is difficult doesn't mean I want to give up. I love a good challenge. They help me grow. This one just isn't worth pursuing at this time.
