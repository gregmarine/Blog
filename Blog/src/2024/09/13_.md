## 8:00am

Good morning...hehehe

It has already been an interesting morning. I went to bed around 1am and woke a little before 6am...LOL I woke up praying again today. That happens sometimes. It starts as a dream and then becomes an intentional prayer as I'm waking up. I cannot really say I understand how that happens. But I can say that I'm very grateful for it. It is such a wonderful way to wake up!

I physically got up shortly after. I was able to do my daily devotional and prayer walk early as a result. And was able to begin my work day early as well. I'm taking this short break to start another timestamp journal entry. It felt right to do this again today considering the oddness of having very little sleep and the manor by which I woke today. It seems as though something amazing may happen again today.

Honestly, though, every day can be amazing if I simply find Jesus in everything. I don't mean that passively, of course. I genuinely mean this. Having such focus on Him lately has been life changing!

By the way, today is my *workiversary*!!! I started with my previous company on this day in 2021. I had been a contractor before that from June of 2020 until September 2021. So, I've been with the company for 4 years, technically. I've been an employee for 3. When I transitioned to the new company in July, they transferred the start day and tenure as part of the contract. I'm basically back to being a contractor without having lost the years of service for HR purposes. Pretty cool, eh?!

## 10:15am

I had left over Bulgogi fried rice for breakfast...LOL I was super hungry when I woke up today. I am out of sourdough for toast. So, I went with what I had. It was basically steak and eggs with vegetables and rice. And it sure was tasty!

I got a late start on my coffee today. Actually, I almost skipped it altogether. Which is really weird considering how little sleep I got last night...hehehe I suppose I must have had enough sleep to not feel tired today. I count that as a win!

I sent my grandmother the videos of It's a Small World I took last night. That is her favorite attraction at Magic Kingdom. 75% of the reason I ride it is for her. The other 25% is nostalgia...LOL I can't wait to see the original at Disneyland in November.

I need to remember to ask her if she has ever ridden it there. Although they lived near Disneyland for a few years, the park was pretty new and I'm not sure if they ever actually went. It's my understanding their house was pretty close. I think they may even have been able to see Disneyland from their property. I've thought about driving by the house to see it...hehehe Actually, I wonder if the park was finished by the time they moved back to Indiana...hmmm...questions to ask grandma! LOL
