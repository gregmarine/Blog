Happy Halloween!..hehehe

I don't always *celebrate* this holiday. I am certain I didn't do anything last year...LOL This year, I decided I'd wear my Olaf Disney bound attire. I've had one of those years where I just want to be myself. This is very *me*...hehehe

This weekend marks the one year anniversary of my runDisney race! I'm not participating this year. But it is still worth thinking about. It was the literal finish line for the start of my physical health journey last year. A lot has happened since then. But that was the goal I was aiming for to see if this journey would become a lifestyle. And a lifestyle it did indeed become! Yay!!!

I stayed up late for the game. And I had a rough morning transitioning from being asleep to being awake. My upstairs neighbor was much more active than usual. It was difficult to remain asleep with all the *stomping* he was doing. He wasn't actually stomping. But it sounds like that being under him...hehehe I think this apartment is the first I've had where someone was above me. I'll keep this in mind for my next place...LOL

I wore my Olaf bound all day. When I walked, I was in full Olaf. While I worked, full Olaf. I walked with Autumn to the Dollar General and 7 Eleven, full Olaf. I'm still wearing it as I write this journal entry...LOL I only took off my hat to cool down a few times after a few of my walks. I rarely wear a hat this long...hehehe I pondered doing crazy things like this more often. Perhaps not all the time. But from time to time. If I keep it rare, it will remain special. If I do it too often, it won't be as much fun.

Today's entry is short and sweet. It started as a timestamp entry. But I quickly gave up on that...LOL I started it at 9am. I never got back to it. It is now after 10pm and I've decided to wrap it up and still publish it.
