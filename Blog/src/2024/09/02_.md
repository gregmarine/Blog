# TBD

A new week and a new month! Happy September! The beginning of the *ember* months...hehehe Many celebrate this as the end of summer and start of Fall. I do not. I see it as the last three weeks of summer...hehehe Even when I lived in Indiana, it still felt like summer until October. However, when I was kid, this was about the time when school started. So, I suppose there was a time when this week felt like summer was over...LOL

The only thing I left out of my journal entries about my North Carolina trip was how I dropped by Disney World on my way home. Since I drove, and Orlando was on the way home, I thought it would be nice to end the trip there. Also, it looked like I would be arriving in the area around dinner time. Perfect timing, if you ask me...hehehe I arrived shortly after a storm had passed and was greeted with a rainbow as I entered the parking lot of EPCOT.

I decided to have dinner at the Rose & Crown in the UK pavilion. This was my first time experiencing this one. I rarely do the table service restaurants at EPCOT. The many festivals they have keep my stomach full with all of the food booths. In the *off season* without festivals, I like to give the tables service places a try. I really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and even the price.

I believe it is one of those restaurants not run by Disney themselves. I think most of the EPCOT table services are run by companies from their respective countries. Of course, the feel of cost is relative to the one paying...hehehe What isn't expensive to me might be expensive to someone else. Then again, most people throw away their thoughts on cost while they are at Disney. They know going in that it isn't cheap. Disney *magic* allows people to ignore the numbers...until they get home and see the ledger...LOL

The rest of the evening was pleasant. I walked around a bit. I also had a small bite to eat in the Japan pavilion. I always love their food and couldn't pass up the opportunity to enjoy it again...hehehe I enjoyed some people watching and overall ambience of EPCOT. It is my favorite park, after all.

I believe I've mentioned this before. I've been going back and re-reading past journal entries. As of this morning, I have already gone through all of January and February. It has been nice to see how I've grown since the beginning of the year. Aside from that, I'm also logging key things from those entries I'd like to revisit or expand upon. I'm making note of all the *Vitamin G* I've added more context to. And I'm keeping track of ideas for possible chapters of one of my book projects.

One of the many things that stand out is how my thoughts have evolved this year. As of the end of February, I hadn't yet started the daily devotionals I've been doing with Cherie. It is interesting to see how some of my beliefs have changed in such a short time. It has been almost six months since we started our devotionals. Yet, they have been an eye-opening, mind-blowing, and heart-growing experience. To see such results so quickly is encouraging.

As a side note: I got the first devotional book at the end of February, as mentioned in the [Olaf Trifecta](../02/26_car-tarpon-olaf-and-meetups#olaf-trifecta) section of one of my past journal entries...hehehe I didn't start it right away. After a few weeks, I decided to ask Cherie if she'd like to join me on it. Her response was *Of course!* We have been doing a devotional daily since...hehehe

I believe it is okay for beliefs to evolve over time. New information should help clarify our thoughts, right? Having an open heart and mind is a way to admit I really don't know much...hehehe So long as my core beliefs do not change, I'm happy to keep an open heart and mind to learning new things. My deepest core belief is that God is my creator, He came to earth as Jesus to save me from my sins, and has provided the Holy Spirit to help guide me on this path. Everything else is just the details...hehehe
