# Favorite Month, Vacation Mode, and More to Come

## Birth Month

Happy March!!! And Happy Birthday month to meeeee!!!! hehehe

Historically, I haven't celebrated my birthday for an entire month. It really isn't in my personality to celebrate myself at all. Last year, I pretty much gave myself a break and celebrated most of March. It was fun-ish...hehehe I even invited anyone who was interested in celebrating with me at Disney World last year the week of my birthday. A total of 8 people came throughout that visit. It was nice.

I originally planned to be in California for my birthday this year. I wanted to celebrate at Disneyland and visit with family and friends. That did not work out. That's okay. I'll get to California eventually. Hopefully later this year after all of the work stuff settles down.

So, what am I going to do for my birthday this year? I'm not sure. Possibly nothing...LOL Last year was an experiment. Should I experiment again this year? Probably not. I'm finding happiness in my every day life now. I really don't need to chase after big moments anymore. Last year taught me quite a bit about living in the moment. I chased after big moments last year. It was not worth it for me.

This year's birthday isn't a milestone of any kind. Last year, it was my 45th. With it being my 46th this year, I'll most likely just celebrate internally the fact that I'm here for another year and that I'm happier and healthier than a year ago. Plus, this is my favorite month!!! Yay!!!

## Vacation Mode

I'm still in a sort of vacation mode. After work on Tuesday, I drove to Disney World for a mini vacation. As soon as I arrived, I extended my plans through Friday. I had already taken Friday off in anticipation that I wouldn't be productive. So all it really meant was that I was going to be switching hotels Thursday...hehehe

Tuesday night was nice. I settled in on having dinner at the sushi place in the Japan pavilion at EPCOT. I went back and forth on where I'd have dinner that night. But for some reason...hehehe...I keep going to the sushi place...LOL Needless to say, I love eating there. I rarely order the same thing twice in the 5 or 6 times I've been there since it opened last Fall. They have such tha varied menu!

They sat me back the windows and my reservation was just in time for the nighttime show in the World Showcase Lagoon. It was perfect. At the end of my meal, they kept telling me not to rush but did keep checking up on me because they were technically closing. So I did end up rushing myself. I didn't mind, though. And when I left, most of the park was empty. I was able to snap a few photos of things without other people in the way. I think I'd like to drive to each park at night and stay long enough for them to clear out so I can take more nighttime photos.

The rest of the vacation went pretty well. And now I'm home. I may sprinkle in more about my adventures as I continue to journal today. At this point, I'm trying to decide if I want to do anything vacation-y near home today and tomorrow. I'll be going to church in the morning. And I have a Zoom call with Chérie later on today. But other than that, no vacation plans this weekend. Normally I would take a few days to relax. But I've still got so much energy...hehehe Which is strange for me. Spending 4 days at Disney usually wipes me out. Yet here I am, ready to GOOOOO...LOL

## Rest

Well, I didn't end up going anywhere...hehehe I just stayed home and mostly relaxed. I did some writing and watched some movies and TV while I wrote. With being gone the last few days, it was nice staying home.

Chérie and I had a lovely chat on Zoom again today. It is always a pleasure seeing her. Once again, we had do a few back and forth "meetings" because Zoom has a 40 minute limit. But that's fine. It means we don't have to pay for the calls...hehehe

I gave more thought to working on some new pieces of art. One thing I'd like to do is more sets. By that, I mean multiple related paintings. For example, I'd like to do more Olaf paintings. But I'd also include other characters from the Frozen movies. And for Bambi, I'd like to do a full set of characters to go with my Thumper painting.

I also continue thinking about making music. That's something that keeps coming up in my heart. I'll likely begin by working on my own arrangements of existing songs. That practice will surely spark what I'll need to write my own originals someday. I've been wanting to do this for about 25 years now...LOL I've been a bit distracted...hehehe

Having a day of rest has really opened up my mind to this creative process of mine. I really think this is going to be a good year for my creativity.

One of my creative outlets is my photography. And I was able to work with that while at Disney this time. I took my camera and the weather was pretty good for capturing photos with natural sunlight. On Wednesday, I was able to capture all of the topiaries throughout EPCOT for the Flower and Garden Festival. I've not accomplished that before. I'm looking forward to seeing how those turned out!

## Meetups

I'm done with meetups for the time being. Although it was nice to see my friends on Wednesday, it really isn't my scene. There was a lot of drinking that night. I didn't drink very much myself. But there were definitely some heaving drinkers this time. To each their own! I'm must not into it myself.

I didn't end up getting to bed until around 2 or 3 am that night. I should have called it a night much earlier. I'm not actually sure why I hung around that late. Perhaps it was because I knew this was going to be my last?

I was offered to let some of them know if I wanted to hang out the next few days. I did not end up reaching out to anyone. I just continued my vacation adventures by myself. And I only shared my time with Chérie by sending her photos and videos. I did send a few photos to my best friend Dan and a few to Tyrese. But they were all the usual photos of the icons...like the castle at MK, Spaceship Earth at EPCOT, and the Chinese Theatre at Hollywood Studios. I may have also sent some of the Hollywood Tower Hotel (Tower of Terror). But the rest was all just for Chérie as she was the only one I was carrying in spirit on this trip.

I'm not sure when I'll be back to Disney. It will be a random visit. I have no plans until May when my parents come down. I'm sure I'll be back before then, though. I did take advantage of the Festival foods on this trip. I went through my passport book and checked off quite a few food and drink items. I was even able to get the 5 stamps I needed for the special Dole Whip treat and collectors "glass" for the festival. It is only the second time I have ever done the stamps. And the first time I've done so much when a festival first starts...hehehe

## Wrap Up

Although I could write a lot about my trip, I'm finished writing for today. I have a few things left to do before bed. I didn't sit and write in this journal all day like I had thought I might. I was busy writing other stuff...more on that to come!

I have a lot to pray about and think over...perhaps there is more to come on that as well...
