# Don't Worry

Today's lesson from *The Chosen* devotional (book 4, day 25) hits home for me. This isn't the first time these devotionals have talked about worry. But each time, they provide a different perspective. My hand written journal for today was brief. As I reflected on the devotional, I decided I would keep those notes brief this time. I have far too much to say about it than what I could physically write on paper. I hope to document more of my thoughts in my online journal. It's far easier for my type than to hand write...hehehe
