# New Grocer, Food for Thought, Dog Toys, and Frozen

## Cold

I had a pretty *cool* day! I did my usual morning routine. But then I went to the movies...yay!!! I may have mentioned this yesterday, but I went to see *Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*. I wore my *I'm So Cool* Olaf shirt...hehehe I wanted to show off what the true Frozen Empire was...LOL And that *King* Olaf's warm hugs could overcome the coldness of fear...hehehe Part of the movie plot is that there is this ghost that can kill you through literally freezing you through fear. The theatre was so cold. I should have brought a jacket...LOL

## Dog Toy Shopping

After the movie, I did some dog toy shopping! It had been a while since I've done that. I miss it! Pet shopping is one of the best joys in the world. I do miss my pets and always hope they are happy and well taken care of without me. Today's little adventure was so much fun! This time it was for Mr. Long Legs...hehehe I can't say here what it is I got for him just yet. His momma reads my journal...LOL She knows it's coming. But not what it is. I'm hoping to get the package out in time for it to arrive for Easter. I hadn't planned it as an Easter gift or anything. But I just noticed today that it might arrive in time...hehehe I wanted to get a warm hug. After all, why should his momma get all of the warm hugs...LOL j/k

## Sister Visit

I got to see my sister today. One of the pet stores I went to was only a few miles from her house and work. So I dropped in on her to give her a warm hug from her older brother...hehehe Honestly, I needed the warm hug from her. I don't see her as often as I'd like. I decided not to move this year as I've previously mentioned. But I have thought about moving closer to her. Maybe next year? I love her little city. It would be nice to see her and her soon-to-be husband more often.

The place she works has a seasonal aisle and right now it is full of Easter candy. I was so tempted to buy some...LOL I'm not kidding! I almost did get some. I resisted well enough to leave without getting any. It isn't that I can't have candy. The occasional indulgence isn't going to harm me. The problem is my addiction. Had I purchased some today, I would have likely bought way more than the *occasional indulgence* portion and triggered my addictive habit again. God helped me kick that habit in January. I don't want to slide back into now. I had some chocolates from that dinner on my birthday, as well as the chocolate mints at Olive Garden. That is fine. That's the *occasional indulgence* I can handle. But that candy aisle...HAHAHA That does it for me...LOL

## Sprouts

Later in the day, I visited the local Sprouts Farmers Market for the first time. I had something similar up in Indiana. I don't recall off hand what it was called. But it looked identical with the exception of the branding. I was there to get some specific ingredients for some bread I'm going to try making next week in support of my friend Chérie...aka Mr Long Leg's momma...hehehe I won't go into details about the *support* because her story is hers to tell. But I have been intrigued by many of the foods she has talked about on her journey. This will be the first of a few recipes I'm going to try out. After I've tried it, I'll likely tweak it later for my own person preferences. This is going to be fun!

While I was at Sprouts, I scouted it out as a potential new grocery for me. I've been displeased lately with my current one. I love the location and I don't mind the slightly higher prices over places like Walmart. It is a quiet store and everyone is super friendly. But the quality of everything is really not good. The Sprouts I checked out, however, appeared to have much higher qualify goods. Especially the seafood, meat, and produce. It is in a nice location near my church, doesn't seem too busy (at least when I went), and everyone was super friendly. The prices are comparable to my current grocer. So I don't feel my budget will be taking a hit. And although I will be eating less of those *plant-based* foods, they do have a much larger selection of that stuff. Not all of that is bad. Mostly just the meat alternatives; which I've pretty much cut out now.

## Food for Thought

I did some thinking today about something that happened to me on my birthday. I had absolutely no anxiety, fear, or doubts about where I was going or what I'd be doing when I went on my little botanical adventures. That is unusual for me these days. For years, I have been tormented by anxiety, fear, and doubts about my travels. Seeing that I didn't suffer any of that on my birthday meant I wanted to understand it a bit better.

I've already talked to her about it, but I think *taking* Chérie along with me in spirit was why. Sending her photos and a few videos kept me focused. Plus, I was scouting out some potential places I'd go for a little shared experience we may get to do next month when she goes on a little adventure herself. While thinking about this connection today, I got to thinking about why it was I typically get anxious when I am exploring. I'd like to unpack my thoughts and use this has an opportunity to not only learn more about myself, but to also resolve whatever it is that is causing it.

What I may do is unpack it little by little over time. I don't want to jump to conclusions before everything is *on the table*. The most prominent thought that came to mind today was, *do I attached people, places, and things to my anxieties, fears, and doubts?* And conversely, *do I attached people, places, and things to my joy, happiness, and excitement?*

While some attachments can be beneficial, are some harmful? I'm no psychologist and don't really have answers to these questions beyond speculation and self examination. What those questions have done for me today is ask more questions...hehehe Such as, *what if that person, place, or thing was no longer in my life?* And if so, *would I be able to let go of the feelings attached to them?*

At the moment, these are rhetorical. I'm happy to entertain any thoughts on it even now. But as I said above, I don't want to jump to any conclusions yet. Just food for thought...hehehe
