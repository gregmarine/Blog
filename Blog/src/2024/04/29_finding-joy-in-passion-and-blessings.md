# Finding Joy in Passion and Blessings

## April 28, 2000

In my haste to finish my journal entry yesterday and try to spend my evening relaxing and recovering, I completely failed to mention that yesterday was a significant day in my journey...hehehe It was the anniversary of the day I met my son's mother. 24 years ago, I was doing a live album recording for one of my brother's college bands. She was attending that concert on her last day of college classes as she was about to graduate. She and my brother knew each other through one of the campus ministries at the college they both attended.

My brother was well known for his adventurous road trips he had thrown together over the course of his college career. He later inspired me to throw together some amazing road trips myself that I would often do while I was working the music production for his bands. As he was no longer actually in college, he had pretty much passed on the road trip king crown to me. Funny thing is, I didn't go to college. But I was around the college ministry and all of my brother's bands. So it was like I was one of them...hehehe

She had never actually been on one of these road trips. So she approached my brother that night and asked if he would throw one together for her since it was her last day of classes. He called me over and introduced me to her and asked if I would design a road trip just for her. I was happy to do so and quite honored that he would consider me for the task for such a special trip.

I asked someone for a map of the area so I could plan out the trip. Back then, we didn't have maps on our phones...LOL So this was a paper map. Someone spotted the *tallest waterfall in Indiana*. It was about a 30 minute or so drive away. Definitely close enough for a road trip later that night...hehehe This waterfall had something special about it besides being the tallest in the state. It happened to be a part of a dry creek...hehehe Basically, there was only a waterfall when it was raining...LOL This made it the perfect choice! Since it wasn't raining that day, the tallest waterfall was nothing more than a small drip...hehehe

Something I liked to do for my road trips was to turn them into a worship service. On our way, I stopped off at a convenience store to pick up some drinks and chips to represent the blood and body of Christ for us to take communion with. I think we ended up getting water and Fritos. Once we arrived at the waterfall, I spoke a prayer and then performed communion for the group. I think there were 10-15 of us there that night, including my son's mother. We sang worship songs and had a wonderful late night with God.

On the way back to campus, everyone in my van but her and I fell asleep. I was driving and definitely needed to stay awake...hehehe She chatted with me and thanked me for giving her this road trip. I was happy she enjoyed it and grateful to God for providing the opportunity to bring so many together for a fun filled evening of worship. The next day, I saw her again at a church we all met up at for a special choir concert being performed by the campus ministry's choir. That's when the spark between us began. We exchanged contact information and began talking. A year later, we were married and 4 years after that our son was born. If it weren't for that road trip, my son wouldn't exist. So, I celebrate the day in my heart each year on April 28th.

## Random Thoughts

I'm feeling a bit better today. The day started off just as bad as I felt yesterday. But I'm feeling better this evening. I think I'm going to chalk this up as allergies after all. Although it seemed to have started a few days before the gardens, I think the gardens are what triggered this. I wonder if wearing a mask when I visit any of the various gardens around here would make a different? Would that reduce the amount of pollen going into my sinuses? I'm guessing it would. That's something to consider next time...hehehe

I wrapped up the current phase of my project at work today. That felt really good. Now it's on to the next phase of work. This next phase needs to be finished by the end of May. It will probably only take a few weeks, actually. I'm going to miss this project once it is complete. It has been a fun little project. Even if I'm still part of the team that owns it, it isn't the sort of application that needs a lot of maintenance or new features. This is one of those once in a decade sort of apps...hehehe

I bought a tofu press last week. I'm using it for the first time tonight. Previously, I would press it using a couple of wooden cutting boards, a towel, and something heavy on top. The press I got is variable. For this first try, I just set it the max. At the moment, I see a lot of water sitting in the reservoir. So it looks like it is working. I'll be working with a lot of tofu tonight to prep for the freezer.

## Passion

Today's *The Chosen: Book One* devotion (*Day 4: Words*), was once again very thought provoking. I didn't have much to write in my reflection notes this time. But I do have further thoughts on a portion of what I did write. I would like to give more thought to the possibility I may have found what I'm currently passionate about.

A few weeks ago, I wrote about how I hoped to find my passion by letting my [Purpose point to Passion](12_purpose-passion). The reflection from today got me to thinking about how I am happy but that not much was actually bringing me joy lately. That's when I realized that I do find joy in sharing The Word with others and praying for others. So, perhaps my passion is to simply follow Jesus?

In my previous entry, I pondered what my passion could be. As I mentioned in that entry, I'm quite the over thinker. Bearing that in mind, I stripped away the complexities of my thoughts and was left with my purpose at the very least being to love God with all my heart, mind, soul, and strength. And to love others. I draw this from:

::: details Mark 12:28-31 AMP
Then one of the scribes [an expert in Mosaic Law] came up and listened to them arguing [with one another], and noticing that Jesus answered them well, asked Him, “Which commandment is first and most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The first and most important one is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul (life), and with all your mind (thought, understanding), and with all your strength.’ This is the second: ‘You shall [unselfishly] love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these."
:::

Today's devotion was specifically about Jesus' words and that He was The Word.

::: details John 1:1-5 AMP
In the beginning [before all time] was the Word (Christ), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God Himself. [Gen 1:1; Is 9:6] He was [continually existing] in the beginning [co-eternally] with God. All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him not even one thing was made that has come into being. In Him was life [and the power to bestow life], and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness did not understand it or overpower it or appropriate it or absorb it [and is unreceptive to it]. [Gen 1:3]

I've been in The Word daily for well over 6 months now. Although I've been in the Word my entire life, the intensity of my focus has never been as great as it as been these past months. Not only am I drawn to it, I'm finding myself craving to know more and more about Jesus. How He loved, how He lived, and how He spoke. I just can't seem to get enough...hehehe I find joy in being in the Word. So much so, that there have been a few times I stopped what I was doing at Disney World and sunk into it right in the middle of a theme park!

There have been moments when I felt the Spirit prompt me to share scripture with others. When this happens, I pray about it and then send the passage via text or email. The medium depends on how long the passage is and if I might need to add some context to why I sent it. If it is short, I text it. If it is long or requires a great deal of context, I'll email it. I find great joy in this.

In a similar manor, I have felt the Spirit lead me to pray for specific things for specific people by praying specific scripture passages over them. This is most often in my private prayer time. I have on occasion spoken the scripture prayers when I've prayed with someone. Once again, I find great joy when this happens.

A little over 25 years ago, when I say I officially gave my life to Christ, I started a prayer ministry. I'm sure I've mentioned that in this journal a few times. I've been pondering resurrecting that ministry. Back then, I also felt called to become a pastor. I've further pondered if He is calling me back to that as well.

Considering I find joy in those things, I'm definitely wondering if I have found my passion.

## Grocery Blessings

A few weeks ago, I had a few items to pick up from the grocery and I decided to give Aldi a try again. I needed Pico de Gallo and ghee. As it turns out, the ghee they sell is a little subpar. I didn't know. The ghee I had previously purchased at Publix and Walmart looked the same. Apparently, all of the ghee I've gotten isn't high quality...hehehe Well, I didn't know. I'm new to ghee...LOL The Pico de Gallo was pretty good, though.

I've had a hit or miss experience with Aldi. Some products turn out great for the price. Others, not so much. Besides ghee, another miss I've had there are their meats. I've had trusted people rave about the quality of their meats. Back when I still ate meat, I gave them a try. That was a one and done for me. I know quality meat...Aldi does not have quality meat...LOL Actually, I use to know quality meat. Now, I wouldn't trust me with that...hehehe So take this as opinion only and not advice...LOL

After I selected my ghee and Pico de Gallo, I headed up front to the registers. There was a single cashier and a line of 5 people with shopping carts filled to the brim. Fortunately, I wasn't in any hurry. It was my lunch break. I live close and didn't mind the idea of waiting one bit. I've rushed most of my life. I'm done rushing. I'm learning to embrace the moment and be patient when necessary.

The gal in front of me, the last of the 5 that were in line as I approached the area, turned and looked at my humble two items. She offered to allow me to go before her as she showed me her cart full of groceries. Although the next moment was likely only one second, in my mind, time had paused for about a minute. I pondered whether or not I would accept this offer.

In the past, I would typically decline out of what I would have called humility. Another thing I was considering was the fact that I was in no hurry whatsoever. Then I pondered what it might mean if I did accept the offer. That threw me onto another track on my train of thought...hehehe

On one hand, would my accepting the offer make me look like I thought I was more important than her? On the other, was this her one random act of kindness that she wanted to do that day? Then again, why was I overthinking this!?

All she was doing was offering me to go before her because I clearly wasn't going to take up much of her time by going before her...hehehe Before I allowed my mind to go into a tailspin, I needed to make the decision! I gratefully accepted her gracious offer and proceeded to go in front of her cart.

What happened next was quite unexpected. The gentleman who was next in line overheard this small interaction and he turned to see that I only had the two items. Following the example of the first gal, he graciously offered to allow me to go in front of him as well. Seeing that this was becoming a double blessing, I didn't give it much more thought and gratefully accepted his offer as well.

At this point, I was feeling a little bit special...hehehe I've been offered to go in front of people before. Most of the time of which I would decline. But this time, I had been offered the same blessing twice...in a row! As this was going on, the person who was already at the register was finishing up. So there were no longer the original 5 and I had already gained 2 spots in line.

As the next person at the register was beginning to place their items on the belt, the gal behind him and in front of me moved her cart out of the line slightly and offered me to go in front of her...WHAT!? A third person offering me the same blessing?! This seemingly simple situation is something I have never witnessed in my 46 years. What was happening and what can I learn from this???

Now that I was next in line, I felt extremely blessed by what had just happened. When it was my turn, it took all of 15-20 seconds to have my two items rung up and for me to pay. I then got the attention of the 3 people who graciously offered me their place in line and thanked them all from the bottom of my heart and told them how much I appreciated them all. Each one of them smiled and offered their welcomes.

What have I learned from this interaction? It's simple, when we accept even the smallest of gestures, the person offering the help can be just as blessed as we are. Sometimes they are blessed even more. By accepting that first offer, it allowed the next two people to perpetuate the same act of kindness. Had I declined the first offer, no one would have been blessed in that manor. And those who witnessed this would have lost out on a blessing as well. For all I know, everyone there that day went on to do similar things later that same day or for the days that followed. Furthermore, what if one of those folks were having a bad day and this one event was what turned their day around?

I really feel as though those 3 received a greater blessing than I did that day.

::: details Act 20:35b AMP
...remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed [and brings greater joy] to give than to receive.’
