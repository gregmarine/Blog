# TBD

I had a late night last night. After I finished my entry, I ended up on the phone with my brother. I followed that up with a call to my parents. That landed me in bed after 11pm...hehehe I still woke up around 6am this morning. I originally woke around 4:45am. But I was like *nope, not gonna get up yet*! LOL

I still wanted to get in all of my prayer, morning devotional time, and Bible reading before work. So I skipped my shave and shower time today. I probably could have still shaved and showered and moved some of the other stuff to later in the day. But I already needed to move my shared devotional with Ch√©rie to lunchtime to accommodate everything else I wanted to do before work starts at 8am. These are just desires, though. The only absolute must do each morning is my wake up prayers and devotional time I do before I get out of bed. I do those regardless. Even when I'm on vacation.

I've been thinking about changing my sleep schedule again. The idea crossed my mind at the time change a few weeks back. But what I would really love to do is work a different schedule at my job. Needing to start work at 8am is my real issue with morning time management. It's funny how a work schedule can set the schedule for the rest of my day. But it is so true for me. If I started work at 9am, I could go to sleep at midnight. Needing to work at 8am means the best time for me to get into bed is 9pm. It sounds weird. But that is actually how my brain's cycles work.

And an even better option would be if I could work from like 10pm to 2am. I could get more done for my employer in those 4 hours than I can get done in the 8 hours they have me working today...LOL I guess choosing a career when I did wasn't the best idea...hehehe I'm the type who should have just worked for himself all these years. I'll probably start working towards that again in the coming years. I can retire from my career early and just work for myself until I can draw from my retirement accounts.

Just some thoughts I've been having lately. Nothing I'm going to act upon just yet. This is not the year to begin making that transition. That's because I'm already in a transition at work. In a meeting today, we were finally given the time frame for when we expect to hear if we are moving to the new company or not. We are supposed to get official word by the end of the week with official offer letters arriving by the end of next week.
