# TBD

25 years ago today I met Lindsay T. in person for the first time. In  my [last journal entry](./22_fingerprints.md), I had mentioned there are those in our lives that leave fingerprints on our hearts. I didn't mentioned Lindsay because I knew I would be writing about her today. At the time, I was running an online prayer chain and her uncle found my ministry through a search on a now defunct search engine...hehehe He asked for prayer for his niece who was dying from and had battled cancer. Her battle had lasted a few years at that point and he was looking to anyone who would pray for her. Their story touched the hearts of the few hundred prayer warriors on my team at the time.

After a few months of praying, I felt called to go see her and pray directly in person. There isn't any extra power in being in direct contact with someone when praying. But there is an added sense of hope sometimes. And for Lindsay and her family, it was an encouragement that someone from 500 miles away would want to travel just to pray with them. Someone in her life, whom I don't recall now, had told her that she would be healed on July 24, 1999. I did not know this at the time, though. And as I was planning my visit, I called her and told her that the best day for me to come was...July 24th...and the year was 1999. When I told her the date, there was a moment of silence and she dropped the fork that was in her hand...hehehe
