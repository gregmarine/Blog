I found yet another way *not* to make an omelette today. What I ended up with was a batch of really good scrambled eggs...LOL I think I'm having trouble due to my pan. I'm doing all of the things I see in videos and described in articles. But I cannot get it right. And I'm not getting consistent results. I have a single egg pan I use for sunny side eggs I put on sandwiches and in ramen or rice bowls. It works perfect every time. I think my larger pan, the one I'm using for omelettes and scrambled eggs, is what is causing my eggs to stick. I'll keep trying and I may buy a new pan someday.

This morning's prayer walk was amazing. The weather was perfect for being outside. I saw the same gal three times walking her puppy. The dog reminded me of the one Cherie is watching right now. White and fluffy...hehehe And the gal reminds me of Cherie as well. I don't know her personally. So I'm speaking of appearance and not personality. She did respond well to my three greetings. I imagine she is a nice person :)

Today's devotional was a continuation of the *don't worry* topic. It talks about God providing. I'm glad I didn't publish all that I wrote yesterday about this topic. Part of what I wrote was along the same lines as today's devotional. So, I definitely want to give it more thought and prayer before I finish writing my thoughts.

One thing that stood out from today's that I hadn't really thought about before was why God provides what we need, beyond the fact He loves us. The quote I chose today was:

>  (*The Chosen* book 4, pg 115) God provides so that we can do the work He's calling us to do.

This comes from:

::: details 2 Corinthians 9:8
And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
:::

I've only ever really thought about His provisions as what I needed to live each day. However, I can see how it would be good to look past my needs. I'm truly trying to trust Him with my journey. Which means my journey is not really my own. So, what He provides me really isn't even about my needs. Perhaps, it is more about what He wants to do with my life?

That's as deep as I'll go with that thought for today. But I think I should explore this more. I'll certainly be praying about wisdom concerning how I use the resources He has Blessed me with. He has good work to do in my life. I want to make myself available for Him to do that good work. I don't want to get in His way...hehehe
