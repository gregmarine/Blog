# TBD

Well, September isn't going quite like I had expected earlier this year. Although it is different than expected, it isn't any better or worse than I envisioned. Part of that is my new (to me) philosophy of expecting nothing while appreciating everything. I may have ideas and thoughts about what I'd like to do in any given time frame or season. But I look at it with hope without disappointment. Hope for the best while not being disappointed if reality falls a little short of the hope...hehehe

I traveled in June, July, and August. The year I moved to Florida, I traveled 13 times. Basically one trip just past traveling every month. That extra trip was due to a hurricane...hehehe Last year, I traveled just twice. After getting past the initial uncertainty about my job's transition, I decided I wanted to travel more this year. I started to feel like going back to the once per month cadence. Unlike 2022, I wanted to travel to other places besides back to my home in Indiana. In June, my trip was in Indiana. July it was California and August was North Carolina.

Yes, I'm saying nothing new. I've been talking about that a lot. Well, I really wanted to travel again in September. My original plans were for California again. When those plans weren't working out, I set my sights on Texas. But then I received a summons for jury duty the week I wanted to travel...LOL It became clear that God might have wanted me to remain at home this month. I'm completely fine with that. I was a bit sad I wouldn't be seeing friends I wanted to travel to see. But I also know that whatever God had in store for the month, it was going to be better in some way.

If the Lord wills it, I think I'd still like to do some sort of travel this month. Instead of a place I would need to fly to, perhaps I could find somewhere within driving distance?
