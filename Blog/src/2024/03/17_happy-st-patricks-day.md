# Happy St. Patrick's Day

The title today is a little on the nose. But that's okay. This is *my* journal, right!? hehehe

I feel like this *holiday* is a part of me in a way. It's proximity to my birthday, plus my part Irish heritage make today a little extra fun. I don't really celebrate it traditionally, though. I did have corned beef and cabbage last night for dinner because of the holiday. But I didn't make it. I ate out with Kerry and his family. We were celebrating his birthday; which is tomorrow on the 18th. I told them it was also my birthday on the 20th.

We went to a little place called H'ours in Tarpon Springs. The owners are neighbors of Kerry. His wife Nancylee and he both told them it was my birthday coming up. So I ended up with a free key lime pie. Yum! I told them it was Kerry's birthday. He likely got his dessert for free too. But they also brought out a pack of beer from where they owners are originally from as a special gift. We all had a wonderful evening. I also got to meet their son, Brian.

I also had another lovely video call with Chérie yesterday. We talked for quite a while. I think it may have been our longest call to date. One of the topics was our devotional. We started that today. With me being ahead in time zones, I've already reflected and commented on today's. I'm sure I'll hear from Chérie tonight and see it in the morning.
