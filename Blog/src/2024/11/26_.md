# TBD

I didn't take the time to work on my new project these last few nights. After dinner Sunday, I called my parents for my weekly call with them. It got a little late. I started writing this Sunday night at about the time I normally sit down to work on that project. But my brain didn't want to be creative that night...LOL Last night, my path didn't take me to the keyboard at all...hehehe So, I'm finishing this entry today. I also hope to get back to my project tonight. I'm close to finishing the story I'm currently working on.

I watched Monsters Inc Sunday night. It came up in my talk with Cherie that day...HAHAHA I just had to watch it because of her...HAHAHA The movie has a new special meaning and connection for us now. I love when that happens <3

I'm really enjoying our Bible study. I'm glad God brought us to this study after our devotionals this year. I'm sure we'll do the fifth devotional if it comes out next year. But in the meantime, we still have the Bible studies. We'll be starting the second one next month. But one thing I noticed in my notes Sunday is that I tend to write more of a *Sunday school* answer in some of my responses. I've been finding myself expanding on what I wrote by simply talking with her on our call. What I may do with the lesson this week is be more conversational with my responses. Basically, take a more casual approach instead of a formal writing approach. It seems as though I was once a bit more casual than I've been writing lately. I'm not sure why I drifted back to a more formal style. It probably doesn't really matter overall since we do discuss these together. But I want to improve how I communicate in general.

Both church services Sunday were a blessing. They typically are. But this time felt especially blessed. With Community United Methodist, the passage was about the 10 lepers where 9 of them went on their merry way and 1 remained to praise God. This past week's episode of *The Chosen* had the healing of a leper...hehehe I loved how there was some relation between the episode and that sermon; although not directly.

The message at theChapel was reassurance of something I've been going through since October last year. I won't go through the whole message. But one thing I took away was the importance of spiritual discipline. My prayer and Bible time over this past year are building my faith in preparation for all that God has been transforming my heart for...a relationship with Him...hehehe Most of my life, I've had a passive relationship with Him. Now, I'm taking an active role in that relationship. It has been life changing <3 The movie the message was based on was *Young Woman and the Sea*. I ended up watching the full film last night before my shower and bed. It's a great story and excellent film. As it is a Disney film, it is now available on Disney+...hehehe

Today I discovered there is a new property development project happening near where I live. It is to be the largest sports and entertainment destination in the country. Not that I really *needed* another reason to move...LOL But I definitely do not want to be here while they build it or even after it is complete. The traffic here is already horrific. The last thing this area needs is something else to bring in more people.

I love the climate in Florida. I love the wildlife here. And I love Disney. But Florida keeps getting worse with all of these property developments. If Florida continues to develop the land to attract more and more people from all over the world, Florida will stop being Florida. The habitats for wildlife are dwindling more rapidly than ever. It makes me sad. I may have to go back to thinking of Florida as a place I vacation.

I've been talking about moving for most of the year. Part of me wants to stay in Florida someplace. I know at some point I'll be living in California. I don't know the timing of anything, though. California may not even be my final destination. Plus, there could be other stops before I get there. Indiana is still a possibility for a season. But this latest development tells me that where I currently live is definitely not for me anymore...hehehe
