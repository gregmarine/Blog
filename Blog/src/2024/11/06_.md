# TBD

Sometimes it feels like life is getting more difficult each season. However, one thing this year has taught me is that I can trust God. The more I trust Him, the easier life begins to *feel*. It's like I've been saying quite often this year. My circumstances aren't always getting better. And some have gotten worse. But my heart is full of faith, hope, and love. Honestly, I sometimes wish I could share this with everyone I know. It just isn't how this works. God put me on a specific path and taught me specific lessons that brought *me* to where I am today. Perhaps that path will someday be one where He gives me the words to say and actions to do in order to help share this faith, hope, and love with others. Again, I need to trust God with the timing for all I can share with others. It's His Story to be told. I realize it has never been about me.

One thing on my heart that prompted the above paragraph are the election results from yesterday. None of it is really a surprise to me. I avoided social media for the most part yesterday. And I'll be avoiding it mostly again today. The few posts I have seen between these few days are a reminder just how divided people are right now. My heart aches for the people on both sides. I see pain, hurt, and anxiety on both sides. I also see a lot of pride...the sinful kind. All will work out. It always does. God is the one in control, after all. If only I could share the hope I have with those who are struggling with this. And it'd be great to share love with those who are happy this morning so they can be kind to those who are struggling. Although the thought *this too shall pass* comes to mind, that really isn't how I feel today. I feel more like *trust in the Lord with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding*.
