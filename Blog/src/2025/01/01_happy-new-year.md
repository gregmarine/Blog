# Happy New Year!

2025 has arrived! Yay!! I'm so excited!!!

Here is my [New Year's attired](https://youtube.com/shorts/y25XOux-ACY) from last night...LOL Although I stayed home, I decided I'd have a little fun. It was weird, yes. But still so much fun! That was likely what I would have worn to Disney had I gone. I'm very glad I stayed home, though. It was nice to relax as I said goodbye to my best year ever and welcome in the new year.

I recorded [this video journal]() for today. I don't know how often I'll do that this year. But I do want to do these as often as I feel inspired. Today felt like a good day to do one...hehehe

Although I did watch a few movies last night, I was productive as well. I wrote yesterday's journal entry and updated this site with the latest code behind the magic here. Late last year, I contemplated how I would do the journal and where I'd host it. I decided to keep with what I was already doing. I thought the system was being bogged down by the ever increasing files as I add entries. Turns out I was wrong. It still only takes about a minute to process the entire site and deploy it to my web server...LOL So, I'll keep it going on the same system without needing to archive past entries.

The last movie I watched for 2024 was *Big*. The first movie I watched for 2025 was *Fantasia*. I hadn't really planned on watching movies last night. But It was nice having them on as I did other things. I also had two dinners last night. I made soy-less tofu tacos for my usual dinner. And then I had a veggie burger and some broccoli for my second dinner just before the first new year's celebration. I rang in the new year in both the eastern and pacific timezones once again. And started off the year with communion and prayer. Overall, I had a very pleasant evening.
