## This is Not a Test

I'm learning quite a bit this year...hehehe I'm really excited about all this life is teaching me. For a while, I thought I was a failure at so many things. I'd mentally beat myself up over every little thing I messed up in my life. That negative self-talk created a landfill style landscape in my mind that made it difficult to feel any sort of love for the good parts about who I am. I received a text this morning that sounded like something I use to tell myself when I was struggling with the darkest moments of my life. I'll dissect it here in a bit. But it prompted me to think about how my thought life has changed these last 3-4 years; especially the improvements occurring this year. I'll likely turn this into Vitamin G someday...hehehe As for today, it is a poem...

I use to feel like a failure.
But life is a lesson.
I'm still learning.
This is not a test.

I'm still growing.
I'm accountable for my own actions.
I'm not accountable for anyone else.
This is not a test.

I fall down and get back up.
I don't keep trying.
I keep doing.
This is not a test.

I apply the lessons I'm learning.
I keep moving forward.
It isn't about passing or failing.
This is not a test.

The past is gone.
The future isn't here yet.
All I have is now.
This is not a test.

It's just homework.
Preparing me for what's next.
I'm to make the most of what I have today.
This is not a test.

## Text from ~~redacted~~

The text I received revealed a struggle I've seen in my own heart through the years. I'll not judge whether this person was right or wrong with what they said. That is between them and God. I'm reflecting how I have changed from feeling the way this person seems to be feeling today to someone who sees myself and others quite differently. Although they were taking responsibility for their actions and the consequences that resulted, it reminded me how I have taken that too far in my own life. I start by taking responsibility...but then go that extra mile to claim I had been hurting my family for years and their actions are my responsibility as well.

While it is good and well to take responsibility for my actions, I cannot take responsibility for their response or reactions. What I need to do is repent and not repeat the actions. I need to change my behavior. It is really up to them whether or not they forgive me or love me. I feel conviction for how I affect the lives of others when that impact is of a negative nature. And I hope they can learn from it all as I have.

Then there is the other side of this coin. What actions are they responsible for that impacted me? In the text, this person was taking responsibility for the actions of others. Just as it was with me in the past, they felt they had been hurting their family for years and that they deserved dishonor and disrespect. They believe honor and respect are to be earned. I use to feel that way about myself too. Which means honor and respect can be something that is lost. I actually no longer feel that way. The Bible seems to indicate honor and respect are something I am to give regardless. It is the same as with my love. All of these things are about the condition of my own heart, not theirs. Likewise, if they dishonor or disrespect me even when I'm in the wrong, that is about the condition of their heart, not mine.

Something else that caught my attention is that they said seeking human praise and glory is sin. Is it, though? I suppose the answer depends on context and intention. But that's the case with anything. On the surface, this doesn't seem like a sin to me. According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, a sin is *an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law* or *an act regarded as a serious or regrettable fault, offense, or omission*. Although seeking praise and glory as validation from others can be self-serving and possibly narcissistic, does that make it a sin? If doing so causes one to violate the first few of the 10 commandments, then I suppose that could be quantified as a sin.

Only God and ourselves knows what the condition our hearts are in. That really is the only way to answer any of this anyway. That's why I am writing this out in my journal. I'm not posing any of these questions to them. My response to them was to remind them to forgive themselves and apply what they were learning for next time.

Jesus revealed to me this morning that I alone was at fault for what went down on Sunday. I woke up feeling rebellious, because I wasn’t getting love and respect on Father’s Day. The spirit reminded me how I’ve hurt my family for the last 17 years and that honor and respect needs to be earned. He also reminded me that seeking human praise and glory is sin. It is self serving. 

God deserves the honor and glory for every thing that He orchestrates in my life. I am a worm. He is God.
