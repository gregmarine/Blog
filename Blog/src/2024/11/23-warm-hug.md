# Warm Hug

I'm Greg and I like warm hugs <3

Today was a special Disney day...hehehe I went to the last day for this year's Food and Wine Festival at EPCOT. And I did so in my Olaf Disney bound...hehehe Although I have worn that twice since I debuted at EPCOT last year for Thanksgiving, this was my first time doing so again at Disney. And boy am I glad I did it again today...LOL I've now worn it a total of four times. I'll wear it again for sure. I may update it a bit. But it will happen again...LOL

The day started off like most days with the exception of going to bed a little early last night and waking a little early. I wanted to snag a virtual queue group for Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind. Since that happens before my usual wake up time as of late, I wanted to be sure to get up earlier...hehehe

But before that, I did my morning prayer and read today's Bible in a Year reading. First things first, God! I don't always do the Bible reading that early, but I have been lately. The prayer, though, is always first. That has been the case since early October last year...hehehe After my time with God, I managed to shave the sides of my face and neck before the virtual queue time came. Then, after I got the group, I got dressed and headed out the door.

I had to fight with my GPS app a little to convince it which path I wanted to take...LOL I always turn it on even though I typically take the same route. I do so because it can warn me of potential problems along the way. That reminded me of how God does the same thing along my journey to His Kingdom...hehehe I wrote a little note about that in my Bible study notes for this week. This morning was a great reminder of that analogy.

I arrived at EPCOT around 9:20am. So a little after park open. I stayed until about 8:30pm and was heading out of the parking lot around 8:45pm. That got me home by 10:40pm. That seems like a long day. But I'll admit, my current sleep schedule has given me the ability to go all day like this and still have energy left over at the end of the day. As a matter of fact, I'm writing this entry after driving home...LOL

It was too early when I arrived for the festival foods. Luckily, I had the foresight to have eaten a pair of *The Only Bar* food bars on my drive...hehehe

Since I was bounding as Olaf, one of the goals for the day was to hit up as many PhotoPass opportunities as possible. I haven't counted how many photos I have from that yet. But I'm sure it is quite a bit.

As I was walking toward the World Showcase, I ran into the JAMMitors. They are a percussion group themed as janitors that play percussion on trash cans. It is always amazing. No one was gathered to watch them. So I walked over and danced for them to their beat. After they were done, they thanked me for doing that...hehehe One of them noticed my hat with the Olaf twig hair. He called it an antler...LOL He proceeded to tell a dad joke...LOL It went something like, "That antler reminds me of my friend. He's a deer friend of mine." HAHAHA That reminded me of someone...hehehe I gave him a round of applause for his joke...LOL By round of applause, I mean that I clap while doing a circular motion with my hands...LOL A literal, *round* of applause...HAHAHA

I love moments like those the most. They aren't captured by videos or photos. They just exist in our memories. I do like to capture some moments through a lens as to recall the memory later. But I also like it when things happen without being captured. Sort of like my favorite moment from today. More on that later...hehehe

After that, I got several more PhotoPass pictures. One includes my posing in front of the Olaf statue they have there...hehehe And a few in front of the large Christmas tree at the World Showcase. I'll likely post some of those eventually.

My next task was to get coffee...hehehe I hadn't had my morning coffee yet. While I drank my coffee, I waited in line for Frozen Ever After. I wanted to see my pal, Olaf, of course...LOL The line wasn't too bad considering it was so early in the morning. Later in the day, it gets way too long to wait in. I tried to do a funny pose for the attraction photo. It didn't get linked to me yet. I may have to contact them about getting it linked to my account. I want to see it!!! Luckily, it will be easy for them to spot me...LOL I'm front row and dressed as Olaf...LOL
