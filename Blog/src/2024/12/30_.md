# TBD

So, I finally started working on video journaling...hehehe I made this [Silly Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/p3yoVC4sbEA) and uploaded it to YouTube to see how to add video journals without having them show up in my channel. I don't really use my channel anymore. At one time, I wanted to make videos and have a channel for fun. I never really got into it, though. Now, it's mostly an archive of my old stuff. Well, I didn't want to clog up the list of videos with my journals. Uploading that video helped me see how to do what I wanted. I hope I did it correctly. I think I did. The links should work from here while keeping the channel clear.

I next made a real video journal entry. You can see it [here](). With it, my intention was to journal in such a way that I was able to convey how I feel through my voice and body language. I just talked. I felt that typing out how I felt wouldn't express the meaning behind it. So, I'm glad I recorded it as a video. It's raw, of course. It helped with my insecurity of being on camera. I didn't edit it in any way. It is as exactly how I recorded it...hehehe

My insecurity is with my teeth. My mouth is a mess. When I do selfies and what not, I keep my mouth closed. When I talk, I sometimes cover my mouth with my hand. I've seen videos of myself where my teeth are visible and I don't like it. I am what I am. I really have nothing to hide. But I'm like any person who has anxiety about a physical flaw. I'm working to overcome that. Doing these video journals is one way I am facing that anxiety.

I'm going to try do some of this in 2025 on a regular basis. But I'll also try to take my random videos of my adventures and piece them together as a journal entry on those days too. Those will be edited. But that's just so I show the best parts of the day. I'll only be *on camera* in those for the video selfies I make. I'm not a vlogger as seen on social media these days. The vlogs I'll do will be like this blog. Just your basic *me being me* type thing...hehehe I feel like the world needs more things like this...LOL

Now that I've decided to actually do New Year's Resolutions for 2025, I decided I should make sure I knew what that means. The root word *resolute* is an adjective that means *admirably purposeful, determined, and unwavering*. Based on that, I would say the reason I never made them in the past was definitely fear of failure. I was never unwavering or determined in an admirably purposeful way about most things...LOL It's too bad I felt that way before. I've also felt that failure is the key to success. It is one of the aspects of growth in life. But it's never too late to try something new. So, I don't regret having never made New Year's Resolutions in the past. And I'm glad I'm doing it this year.

So, why I did I have to look up the definition?!? LOL I'd say I'm a pretty smart person. As part of my intelligence, I've learned that I'm often wrong about things. I feel it is important for me to refresh my knowledge from time to time. I'm always growing and learning new things. Seeing old knowledge with new eyes is important to me. Common sense things remain common in my mind because I keep it fresh. So, while I already knew what a New Year's Resolution is, it was a good exercise to familiarize myself with it again.

I've been unwavering about some things in my life. Being intentional isn't foreign to me. So, I'll be able to apply an intentional spirit to some of my 2025 goals. I'll remain flexible when something happens that may derail a goal or two. But some of my ideas for 2025 will be things I'll not waver on. My list of resolutions is a mental note. I haven't written most of it down with the exception of the few things I talk about here in the journal. The things I talk about here are the ones I'm flexible about. But the true resolutions are in my heart. Those are the ones I'll be determined to accomplish. I'll be able to accept if I *fail* at any of them because I can always keep trying.
