# TBD

It has been a little over a week since my last entry. I had just come off of a hurricane and Disney trip and ran into a visit with my parents for the week. My parents safely arrived at home today, and new hurricane is on its way...LOL My parents enjoyed their time here. And I enjoyed my time with them. I had concerns a few weeks ago that I would be *entertaining* them and was worried they wouldn't have a great time...hehehe It was a little stressful thinking about that...LOL Yeah, I was wrong. They had a great time. I balanced time with them and time at work. It was a great week. I hope to journal about some of it in the coming days. But we'll see...hehehe I wish I had been able to journal as it happened. And now, I'm facing another hurricane. So, I'm not sure how much I can journal this week...LOL

I miss writing. I wrote so much here last month and I really enjoyed it. I also miss writing poetry and the work I was doing on my books. It has been a while since I've worked on much more than this journal...hehehe I started a creative writing project with Cherie last month. That has been fun to think about and work on. It is actually inspiring me to do more creative writing. It is basically a fictional short story we are writing in tandem. I've not worked on anything quite like it before. I'd like to explore more projects like that one...hehehe

I'm someone who remembers dates and find certain anniversaries to be very important. Anniversaries can be things like birthdays, weddings, or special events. One important anniversary is occurring this weekend...hehehe It has been a year since I made intentionally putting God first each day an important part of my routine. What that means has evolved over the course of the year. But without fail, I have made my first conscience task each day to go to God in prayer. This is before I even get out of bed. I sit up, put my legs of the edge of the bed, and I pray. When I'm at home or in a hotel alone, I voice the prayer audibly. When I'm with someone else, like I was a few days in a hotel room with my parents last week, I'll pray silently to myself. I actually had that about a year ago when I stayed in a hotel with my brother's family as well.

Most days, I also did some sort of devotional in the morning before my day took off. This has been a life changing experience. The idea comes from Matthew 6:33 where Jesus says seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. The pastor at the church I was attending a year ago did a sermon on how we start our day sets the day. He later published a devotional on that theme. Side note: that was the same devotional that Cherie and I started our fellowship journey with back in March. That has evolved into a Bible study we are beginning this week...hehehe
