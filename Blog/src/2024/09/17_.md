Happy Taco Tuesday!!! Have I mentioned I love tacos?!? LOL This week, I'm having a lot of tacos...hehehe I made some last night and tonight. I'll likely have them again the next two evenings as well. Tacos are one of those things that are so simple to make and they are so delicious...hehehe

I had the blessing of running with Lavender tonight. She's one of the neighborhood puppies I run into from time to time. Her owners saw me walking and said, *There's your friend Greg!* hehehe Lavender got really excited. As it turned out, they were headed to the Bark Park in my complex. So, the next five laps around the pond on my walk included some sprints back and forth down the fence line of the park.

I got some selfies with her this time. Autumn shared her appreciation that I run with her. I expressed my appreciation that she welcomes the fun. It is just as much fun for me as it is for Lavender...hehehe We can both use the cardio...LOL

I'm quite happy that I'm able to run. It has been a while since I've done a job routine. I've continued walking. But I rarely get my heart rate up for a run. I've still got the ability! I may toss jogging back into my routine after how I felt tonight. Now that I'm eating breakfast again, I've noticed I have a lot more energy this week.
