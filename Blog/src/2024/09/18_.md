I found yet another way *not* to make an omelet today. What I ended up with was a batch of really good scrambled eggs. This reminds me of the trouble I had earlier this year with new (to me) features of social media. It gives me a sense that I'm ignorant. I've watched videos and read articles about how to make omelets. Every so often I try to master it. Each time, I find several ways not to do it. Unlike my earlier social media frustration, this one is something I still haven't figured out yet.

I'll keep trying. Just because something is hard for me doesn't mean I'll give up. I know I'll figure it out. I know people who find them very easy to make. Even when I've described my experience with it, they look at me as if I'm the stupidest person on the planet. I think what frustrates me most is that some things with cooking just click with me. Yet this one gives me anxiety. I truly mean anxiety. It even hurts my chest. I'm writing about it because I need to get this feeling out of me.

Part of me thinks my pan isn't good. I've had issues with it for other things too. So, maybe I should find a new pan and try that. The problem is the eggs stick to the pan regardless of whether I use ghee or olive oil and regardless how much of either that I use. The temperature doesn't seem to make a difference either. No matter how low I go, it sticks. I know it isn't the eggs because I have a single egg pan I use when I make a sunny side up egg. The egg simple slips out of the pan without issue. That makes me think my larger pan is just bad.
