# TBD

Today started out as a *weird* day for me. At one point, I thought it was Tuesday. At another point I was completely confused about something at work that I have never been confused about. I was late on my coffee and breakfast. My boss randomly pinged me about something and then just sort of ghosted me. Yeah, weird stuff...LOL On the boss thing, that happens sometimes. He's very busy...hehehe But as the day continued, everything seemed to go back to *normal*...

This week, I have moved my devotional time back to the beginning of the day and moved my work start time. So far, I really like this adjustment. Before I switched my sleep schedule a few months ago, I was doing the devotional in the morning and I really liked that. It never felt right to be doing it after dinner as I have been for a few months. So, I'm glad to have it back at the start of my day. I hope to continue this. *Fingers crossed and hands folded*...hehehe
