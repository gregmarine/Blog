# Unsettled

> We can prepare for tomorrow by learning the lessons of today. But tomorrow will be there once it gets here. Donâ€™t sweat tomorrow today.

Todayâ€™s Vitamin G comes straight from:

::: details Matthew 6:34 AMP
So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

As I was finishing my day yesterday, I began to think about what lay ahead for my first work day of the week. I quickly dismissed the thought because yesterday wasnâ€™t over and today had not yet come. This verse, and the context before it, came to mind rather quickly. I believe that being consistent and constant with my prayers and reading of the Word allows me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned. It doesnâ€™t happen all the time. But when it does, it is a Blessing. Of course, this verse is well known and easy to bring to memory. But how often have I actually meditated on and applied it? Not very often at all. As it came to mind last night, I decided it would become todayâ€™s Vitamin G. And if that werenâ€™t enough, my friend Tyrese mentioned it to me this morning after I sent her a text that read, *Itâ€™s going to be okay ðŸ¤—*. I sent that text to encourage her about something sheâ€™s going through. Her response was Matthew 6:34 ðŸ¤­

The reason I didnâ€™t want to think about what today had in store was because I wasnâ€™t finished meditating on the lessons I was supposed to be learning from yesterday. I didnâ€™t exactly plan this, but I attended 3 worship services and heard 3 messages yesterday. At theChapel, the message was about the Lordâ€™s Prayer. At CCGS, the message was from Psalm 25 (which was part of a recent lesson from *The Chosen* devotional Iâ€™m doing with ChÃ©rie), and the message from CCWC was all over the place about the breastplate of righteousness from the Armor of God. All 3 worship times were all songs that I absolutely love to sing to God. It was such an amazing experiencing to spend so much time with God in that manor.

As amazing as it was in the moment, it does bring to Light how I am currently unsettled. Just as Iâ€™m not settled in where I should live, Iâ€™m far from settled on the matter of where I should worship, pray, receive a message, and serve. I have speculated on what this means. Iâ€™ve meditated on it. Iâ€™m praying about it. And waiting on Godâ€™s direction. Itâ€™s much like the transition ChÃ©rie and I are about to take in *The Chosen* book 2. After todayâ€™s, and before tomorrowâ€™s, there is a page titled *There. We Said It.* I donâ€™t normally look ahead. But after reading that page, I glanced at the next several days and noticed each have that statement on their first pages. I didnâ€™t read beyond that phrase, though. It sounds like we are going to experience some truths where, as the author puts it, [theyâ€™re] *gonna say some things that arenâ€™t often said in church. In other words, weâ€™re gonna (1) wrestle out loud as we (2) seek to understand because we desire to (3) follow Jesus well.* ðŸ¤¯ That is *exactly* what I am experiencing in this *unsettled* season!

I donâ€™t exactly know what will come of this chapter of my story. Iâ€™m not going to search for meaning. I know there is definitely meaning to be found. But Iâ€™m going to wait for God on this. I trust in Him. If I were to search for the meaning, Iâ€™m most likely going to manifest my own meaning based on my limited human understanding. *Nope! Not this time Greg!* These devotionals have been taking me on quite the journey so far. And each worship service I experience and message I hear has taught me much. Iâ€™m not going to question it. Iâ€™m going to accept it and simply wait on the Lord. He will give me discernment in this and all matters; so long as I continue to *trust Him with all my heart and lean not on [my] own understanding. In all [my] ways, [Iâ€™ll] acknowledge Him and He will make my path straight[; removing all obstacles in my way].* Iâ€™m going to embrace this unsettled season of my life. It will be just that, a season. Seasons have a beginning and an end. And this is only the beginning! *God, I trust You! In Jesusâ€™ Name, Amen!*
