First, and foremost, Happiest of Birthdays to Ch√©rie! I know she reads this blog...hehehe So I wanted to say that to her, again, here...hehehe I can't wait to see her this weekend <3 It so surreal that I'm currently only a few miles from her right now. We live about 2000 miles apart. But my trip has closed that gap quite a bit...hehehe
