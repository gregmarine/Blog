# TBD

I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and decided I wanted to sleep in as much as I could this morning...hehehe So I slept in...hehehe Yesterday I slept in a little too. But yesterday it was basically that I went back to sleep after my alarm. Today, I pushed me alarm out well past my normal time. I sensed my body needing some rest today. And then in another plot twist, I ended up taking a nap this afternoon...hehehe I had been noticing my brain going through some fatigue last week. So perhaps it needed that extra rest this weekend. I'm feeling fine otherwise...with the exception of the fact I gained about 5 lbs in the last week...LOL I'll keep a close eye on my body and see if it is telling me anything. I hope these aren't warning signs...hehehe I'm certain everything is okay.

I took my normal morning walk this morning. But it was a bit different in a good way. I was offered a dog biscuit...they were joking, of course. I then took a few photos. I then was told *good morning sweetie* by a neighbor I do not really know yet. I enjoyed being referred to as *sweetie* as a term of endearment. It has been a while since someone has done that for me. This same neighbor thanked me for my kindness last week when I interacted with her dog. By the way, the dog biscuit offer was from a different neighbor...hehehe I then snapped a photo of a yellow flower that later shriveled up in the afternoon sun. So I'm glad I snapped that warm hug before it was gone forever! Just before my walk was over, I enjoyed some birds flying overhead and enjoyed a moment watching the fountain. It was a blessed way to start the day.
