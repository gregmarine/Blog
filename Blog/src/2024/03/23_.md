# TBD

I had a pretty cool day! I did my usual morning routine. But then I went to the movies...yay!!! I may have mentioned this yesterday, but I went to see *Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*. I wore my *I'm So Cool* Olaf shirt...hehehe I wanted to show off what the true Frozen Empire was...LOL And that *King* Olaf's warm hugs could overcome the coldness of fear...hehehe Part of the movie plot is that there is this ghost that can kill you through literally freezing you through fear.
