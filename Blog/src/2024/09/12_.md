## 9:00

I've been logged into work for about 45 minutes. I haven't been able to get much done yet because there is an outage with the client's Microsoft apps...hehehe I log into two separate systems. One of them is working fine. I'm not sure if I've explain this yet, but the company I use to work for is now my client through my new company. The Microsoft apps that aren't working are those used by the client...aka, my old company. My new/current company's Microsoft apps are working fine. It seems it might be a routing issue between the client and Microsoft as opposed to some major outage. I imagine it is affecting other customers as well. Just not all. I heard Microsoft posted on Twitter that they are investigating an issue. Best of luck to all involved!

I haven't had coffee in a few days. I think I'll make some and have it today, though. And I'll make some toast. I need to work on a more well balanced diet. I'd like to go back to having eggs in the morning. It has been quite some time since I've done that. During my health journey last year and at the start of this year, I'd continue having hard boiled eggs. But I stopped having eggs for breakfast. Before this journey, I'd have them often. One of the many things I use to be known for were my big breakfasts...hehehe I would post a photo of what I made along with my Vitamin G. When I stopped eating breakfast, I would only post a photo of the sunrise...hehehe

As you can see by the start of this entry, I decided to give a timestamp entry a try today. We'll see if I stick with it and post it later. Of course, if you are reading this, I did follow through and post it...LOL
