# TBD

First, and foremost, Happiest of Birthdays to Ch√©rie! I know she reads this blog...hehehe So I wanted to say that to her, again, here...hehehe I can't wait to see her this weekend <3 It so surreal that I'm currently only a few miles from her right now. We live about 2000 miles apart. But my trip has closed that gap quite a bit...hehehe

People seem to know my hotel well. It appears it is a local chain. I hadn't heard of it before this trip. I chose it due to its proximity to the church. It's actually turned out to be an excellent choice in general. It's really nice. For the most part, it has been quite. I find it really easy to get to. When I adventure off away from the hotel, it has been really easy navigating back. Even coming in from the airport was super easy. The highway was backed up when I was coming in from the airport. But the exit I needed had a lane that was empty. So the traffic didn't bother me at all...LOL And the staff have been really friendly. There haven't been any spontaneous dance parties or random character meet & greets...hehehe But this isn't Disney...LOL

The views around here are amazing. I knew I loved the mountains. But it had been so long since I've been anywhere with mountains that I had forgotten just how much I loved them. Could I possible live in Diamond Bar someday?!? *Maybe*...hehehe Even with my stop in Las Vegas, what I loved seeing the most was the mountains. I could see a few of the famous hotels from the airport. But the mountains were where my eyes were drawn.

Well, today, I ended up on a mountain! Yay!!! I had no idea I would be *climbing* a mountain on this trip. I had absolutely no plans to do so and hadn't even given it a thought. I did look into Eaton Canyon as a possible place to check out. This morning, I prayed about where God wanted to join me for a day of adventure...hehehe I like to ask Him what He wants to teach me through my day's experiences. But today I worded the prayer to be more of *where are we going today?!?* As I've written before about this trip, I didn't want to plan out every moment of this trip. I wanted serendipity and spontaneity to play a role in this adventure. Today's page in the chapter of the book of my life was beyond words. I'll do my best to write a little about it here. But know that what I say does not come close to what it was like while experiencing it.

After I completed today's *The Chosen* devotional, I took a look at the list of places I had looked into. I almost decided to go to Azusa Wilderness Park today. I may go there tomorrow. But I ended up choosing Eaton Canyon because it is near Pasadena. I really wanted to find the *Little Old Lady from Pasadena*...LOL j/k But that song was really why I chose it today over Azusa...hehehe That's how my mind works sometimes...hehehe

I didn't really know what to expect with Eaton Canyon. I looked it up...but websites never capture what one can really expect out of a place like that. When I arrived, the place looked packed. I suppose the holiday had something to do with that? They directed me to the overflow lot and instructed me to park on the street if the overflow lot was full. In my mind, I felt the lot would have a spot for me...and it did...hehehe

After parking, I headed right to the Eaton Canyon Trail. At first, I was like, *well, this is easy*. But my thoughts quickly turned toward the amazing views of the mountains. I started taking so many photos and thanking God for healing my body as much as He has so I could enjoy this adventure. Just 18 months ago, I could barely walk on a flat surface. Yet, here I was walking a hiking trail. The trail wasn't much at the beginning and people from all walks of life were enjoying it...no pun intended...hehehe

At one point, I was given a choice at a fork in the trail. One path led to a view of Eaton Canyon. Whereas the other path led to a water fall. I decided to go to the canyon view because I noticed there were fewer people on that path. As I mentioned above, the park was packed...hehehe

The canyon view was nice...but I'll be honest. It was a bit disappointing. I even got up to a place where the trail led to a neighborhood. But I figured that was fine since I didn't really plan anything. Just about anything was going to fun regardless. But then I noticed another trail connected to the Eaton Canyon Trail. This one was called Altadena Crest Trail. The sign for this trail indicated it would be far more difficult than what I had already hiked. And I was game for it...hehehe

I walked about 1 mile of the Altadena Crest Trail. It wasn't nearly as long as the Eaton Canyon Trail. However, it was actually a mountain trail. There were moments when I was climbing at a 15% grade. That's insanely steep for a lot of people. I definitely could not have climbed that grade 18 months ago. So the difficulty wasn't lite at all. I think it is considered moderate. Not being a seasoned hiker, I'd consider it at least moderate. But I knew it wouldn't be too difficult with my current health status. And I knew God had prepared me for this. Also, I felt like God would tell me when to turn around if the path was going to be too tough for me.

Here is a look at the distance I hiked...From the *P* at the bottom right up to the *hiker icon* in the top left. The *hiker icon* in the top middle next to the blue *trail maker* is where the Altadena Crest Trail begins from the Eaton Canyon park.

The Altadena Crest Trail portion looks a lot shorter...well, it is. That's 1 mile. But considering the grades at various spots, 1 mile is quite a hike up a mountain side. That Eaton Canyon Trail was quite a bit longer. But the grade was nominal. When I got to the top part of this portion the Altadena Crest Trail, I was probably 400-500 feet up from the base? The actual crest is 753 feet from the base. I didn't go that far. I probably could have had I been prepared to do the trail. As it were, I didn't know I'd be doing that today...LOL The photos I took will not do the view justice. But I did take several. Here is one of them...

While I was up there, I spent some time with God. The whole experience was time with God. But I dedicated some specific time to mediate, pray, and read scripture aloud. I'll not describe the specifics as that is between God and I. But I will describe how it felt as best I can. Have you ever had a moment when absolute nothing else existed. Only the moment existed. Although I'm sure there were sounds going on around me in the moment, I couldn't hear anything except my conversation with God. I wasn't thinking about work, anyone who is in my life, or even the fact that I had just hiked up a mountain. It was just me and Him. I didn't think about my health journey. I didn't think about my struggles with loneliness. I didn't think about what I'd be doing later in the day. Absolutely nothing else existed.
