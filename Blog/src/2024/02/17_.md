## Mind Download

As I finally sit down to begin journaling for the day, it's around 10:15 am. There has already been a lot on my mind. I sure wish I could just download all of my thoughts and of it be transcribed into text.

In a way, that's what journaling is. I'm taking my thoughts and putting them into words that at least partial convey the meaning behind those thoughts. I just isn't always in real time. I suppose that's a good thing, though. This gives me time to really think about what I say and how I want to say it.

I actually prefer that in most of my interactions with people...hehehe Once texting became a thing, I welcomed it! I even bought one of those fancy phones with a QWERTY keyboard to make it easy to text. I never did get into using a numerical pad to key out a text. But the nice thing about it is that I can really think out what I want to say. And I can look it over before I hit send.

When I speak with people in person or over the phone, I tend to repeat myself. Before I speak, I've gone over what I want to say several times. So when I speak, it sometimes comes out on my mouth a few different ways. I often wonder if the one listen has picked up on that and is annoyed that I just said the same thing multiple times.

The benefit of being able to download my thoughts is that I can review everything before I put it out there. Sure, there are somethings I'd rather never get out of my head. I imagine it might scare a few people...LOL j/k But it sure would be nice to be able to have a look. Sometimes I think of something I'd like to write down but can't because I don't have a medium nearby to do so. Later, I'm left with wondering what profound statement I wanted to remember...HAHAHA

Then again, it would seem the most important stuff does end up getting written. I'm grateful that I have the means to do what I do. I love to create. And being able to put into words how I feel, what I am doing, and some of the wisdom God has given me to share is an incredible blessing.

## Food, Glorious Food

I've been on this vegetarian diet for almost 4 months now. Sticking the the pescatarian style of the diet has been both challenging and rewarding. I haven't really been craving flesh meats at all this whole time. In fact, that is the reason I gave the diet a try.

My concern now is all of these meat alternatives I've been trying for the last 4-6 weeks. Like any processed food, there are some ingredients that aren't the best. There are always ingredients whose sole purpose is to maintain color or shape of the food. Personally, I don't concern myself with that. I do think appearance and texture are important to the dining experience. However, not at the expense of health.

My overall health, although quite improved over a year ago, has hit a sort of plateau. I'm not loosing or gaining weight; which is nice. My energy levels have been great. However, those have peaked. My activity level could use some improvement. Aside from more exercise, I'm curious what sort of changes I'll be making next with my diet.

I do feel as those flesh meats will become a part of my diet again. I don't really miss it. But I'm also not concerned about animals. Even in the animal kingdom, animals eat animals. What started me on the vegetarian tract was listening to my body. It was telling me to make the switch. I just feel as thought it's only for a season.

If I have a message to give anyone who wonders about my diet and exercise choices, I believe it is this: listen to your body. No one knows how you feel more than you do. And even if you don't understand how you feel, you are your best advocate. There isn't a end all be all routine. And there isn't a quick fix to anything. When trying anything, listen to how your body reacts to it. And if you have health issues, find the root of the problem. Treating the cause is so much better than treating the symptoms.

I was going to write up all the details about my own personal journey. I've since reconsidered. What worked and is working for me may not work for someone else. I'll continue posting on social media about what I'm doing in the moment. But I only hope to encourage and inspire others by example. If I'm more specific, the risk is that someone may try exactly what I'm doing and only make themselves worse.

As a side note, I found myself in Walmart this morning...LOL I need envelopes and didn't want to pay much. I large box was less than $2 there. While there, I decided to venture over to grocery. I found some great prices on scallops and tilapia. So I picked up some seafood while I was there. Those were a few things I had been out of stock of for quite some time.

I think I'm going to start venturing out to the local farmer's markets. Sourcing my eggs, produce, and seafood straight from the farms and fisherman seems like the best idea. I'd rather support small business and the local economy. Plus the ingredients should be better. I believe that will be the next evolution of my diet. Building relationships with the community while giving my body better quality seems like a great idea. Especially if I want to live until I'm 135...LOL j/k

## Sumatra

My favorite coffee brand is [Joffrey's](https://joffreys.com/). Although you can get Starbucks on Disney property, the exclusive provider of Disney branded coffee is Joffrey's. When I started to drink coffee, I loved the connection their brand brought to my love of all things Disney. When I order from them, I rarely get the same blends and flavors more than once.

I mostly order the Disney branded blends and flavors. It started with getting the flavors that are found in the resorts and restaurants. It then grew into ordering flavors based on some of the Disney movies and shows. However, I often do order their other blends and flavors that aren't Disney themed.

Last month, Joffrey's introduced me to a new blend named Sumatra. It hails from Mandheling region of Indonesia. I tried it for the first time this morning. I felt the flavor was rich and bold. It had a slightly sweet finish. The aroma greeted me before each sip and I found the experience of this coffee to be quite pleasant.

I'm not easily impressed with coffee. To each their own on what is best for them. But I absolutely love Joffrey's. This Sumatra blend is one of the top I've had from them. I'll likely order this one again in the future.
