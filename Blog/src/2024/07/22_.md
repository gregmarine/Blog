> Some people leave fingerprints on our hearts. They have touched us in such a way that they have left a lasting and positive impact on our lives. Iâ€™m going to cherish their fingerprints on my heart today.

Today's *Vitamin G* was inspired by something similar I said about a year ago. When I think about this from time to time, there is always someone who immediate comes to mind. His name is Jerry B. It passed away some time ago. But his impact on my life keeps him alive in my heart. I never quite knew what he saw in me back in the 90s. He was a mentor and a friend. Someone who always put the truth in trust.

When we met, he was my boss. Yet, he didn't treat me like an employee. I was a member of his team. He led by example. That sort of boss. More of a leader than a ruler. He corrected me when I needed that but also inspired when that was what was needed. I just no realized that my current boss, Ross H., reminds me of Jerry in a lot of ways.
