## Writer's Block

Typically, writer's block is the condition in which a writer might find themselves in when they lose the ability to produce or experience a creative slowdown. I discovered this morning that I have come across another form of writer's block. In this alternate perspective, I found myself to be so focused on what I was writing yesterday that I neglected some tasks I wished I had performed. Namely, I simply forgot to go through some specific daily devotional time I had planned. My writing blocked my mind from remembering to do that!

I use the YouVersion Bible app to read the Bible. One of the features of the app is "Plans." These plans are scheduled ways to remain in a devotion to reading the Word or studying some aspect of it. As of yesterday, I was involved in 3 such plans. The first is a "Bible in a Year" reading plan so that I can read the Bible in its entirely withing the year. The second is a plan I'm going through with my brother in Christ, Kerry. We are currently studying the book of Acts. The third was one I picked up on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. day that involves what he did for the Civil Rights Movement.

Upon discovering I had neglected all 3 plans yesterday, I went through yesterday's session for all 3 this morning after my wake up daily refresh time. By the way, that daily refresh is also a feature of the YouVersion Bible app. I don't really regret missing my sessions yesterday. After all, I had a lot to meditate on and write about. The topics I wrote about are likely to be expanded upon in future writings. I didn't lose the habit of doing a daily devotional. In fact, like I said, I picked it right back up this morning by completing yesterday's sessions already. And later today, God Willing, I fully plan on doing today's sessions.

That said, I did have a brief moment when I was a bit hard on myself for neglecting those sessions yesterday. I had a goal of following at least the "Bible in a Year" plan to the letter so I would literally read the Bible every single day this year. But then I remembered that I was actually still in the Word yesterday. What I wrote about were things I believe God was teaching me and therefore I searched the Bible for references to what I was "hearing." So, tossing my pride aside for a moment, I quickly felt peace that what happened yesterday was still being used by God in ways I just didn't understand at first. And that is more than okay!
