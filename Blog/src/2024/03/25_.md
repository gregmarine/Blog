# TBD

My heart and mind are wide open. Always have been. This is a double edge sword of sorts. On one hand, that makes it easy for me to course correct when God is helping me navigate my world. On the other hand, when I seek navigational help from the world instead, I can be easily influenced by the world. I need to always feed my open mind and heart with godly influences, not the worldly ones. To be *in* the world, and not *of* it.
