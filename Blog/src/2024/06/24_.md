# TBD

I was a little sad over the weekend. Nothing to be concerned about. In general, I'm still quite happy. It was just a feeling of sadness that kept me thinking. I suppose I've actually been a bit sad for a bit. I've been quiet sometimes. I've been holding back a bit too. Again, nothing to worry about, really. Last night I got to thinking...I'm just tired. I'm physically, mentally, and spiritually worn.

This month, I've taken a break from my typical lifestyle. I haven't gone out and done much. I haven't even been to Disney in a month. I have only eaten out once in the past month or so. I did take myself to a movie and I went out for some ice cream. Those were very much needed distractions in those moments. I suppose in a way, I've been preparing myself for my upcoming trip to California.

I was talking with my parents last night about how I think I'll be going back to my regular lifestyle after that trip. When I return from California, I'm likely going to go to Disney, maybe the beach, and perhaps get back out on the water. I've not done any of that is so long. Then again, I may not do any of that when I return...hehehe Some things I feel like a need to plan. Other things really do not need planning.

I think one of the things that has been making me sad is my *church situation*. Yesterday, I decided it was time for me to leave theChapel. Now I have to decide how to handle that. I don't feel obligated to *announce* it or anything. By *handle*, I really mean how do I answer people who ask me about it. And how do I handle their reaction. I shouldn't care what people think about what I need to do with my life. But I do care how it affects them. I have friends there that could be impacted by this decision. Do I tell them now? Or do I simply wait and see if they reacted to it. I may draft a text and send it to them individually.

What's next for dear old Greg? I haven't a clue...LOL But I am pretty excited for it. My new outlook on my life this year has been really nice. The heart transformation God has been doing in my life has changed my perspective. It's a bit difficult to explain. Perhaps there are glimpses of it in my journal here? I suppose only God and I truly know what is going on inside this heart of mine. As I mentioned above, I've been holding back a bit. I've been quiet about some of it. I feel that's okay. Are we meant to show everything about ourselves to everyone? I don't think so. Being vulnerable to everyone in my life has been problematic at times...hehehe

I need to be discerning about what I show to people. I need to set boundaries. And those who prove themselves trustworthy can get past the boundaries they've earned the right to cross. One thing I don't want to do is allow my past hurt and pain keep from from enjoying the blessings others can bring. Not everyone is the same. Just because I was hurt by person *X* doesn't mean person *Y* is going to hurt me. I cannot measure *Y* with the same scale as *X*. They are different people, right?!?

The same is true for experiences. Just because one experience was bad doesn't mean the next one is going to be bad.
