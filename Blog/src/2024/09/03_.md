# TBD

Back to work today...hehehe The day went well. I don't mind holidays in my work schedule. I tend to be able to pick up right where I left off. I do have times when I'm not sure what day of the week it is. But holidays rarely throw me off anymore. I've been mentally aware that today is, in fact, Tuesday...LOL

Last week, I began implementing a schedule change. I believe I mentioned I moved my devotional time back to the start of the day. As a result, I moved my work start time to 9am. To keep with a stop time of 5pm, I skipped my lunch hour last week. Well, this week, I'm adding the lunch hour back and will extend the stop time to 6pm. Today is the first day for that. So far, I'd say I really like this schedule. It fits better with my sleep schedule.

Last night, I was extremely tired earlier that usually. I was dozing...hehehe So I decided to go to bed early. I got a lot of sleep last night. Apple Health shows that I got 7 hours, 24 minutes of sleep. That sounds about right. I think I should listen to my body on this one...hehehe *Forcing* myself to stay up to a specific time might not be the healthiest choice. I should stick as close to a bedtime as I can. But sometimes, it would be good for my head to hit the pillow earlier if it needs.
