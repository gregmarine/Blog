## Verse of the Day

Today's VotD in the YouVersion Bible app is the prayer that I have literally started each day with for the past 115 days. It's the Lord's prayer from Matthew 6:9-13. It was 115 days ago when Pastor Q challenged me to seek God first every day. He posted on the church website his simple daily routine that he starts with. I have no idea if he does it every single day. But the first thing listed was the Lord's prayer. So, each day before I do anything else, I recite Matthew 6:9-13 verbatim. I follow that up with saying the same in essence, but in my own words. I claim the Lord's prayer as my own. His is a blueprint by which all my prayers should begin, right?

Having this as the VotD was an excellent reminder that Jesus made it easy to know how to pray. And throughout scripture, He shows me what I should pray about. My time in God's Word these past few weeks has truly been an eye opener. My mind's eye, that is. My heart's eye. My soul! From an intellectual perspective, I have always known this as I grew up in the Faith. However, I have not truly understood what all of this means until this season of my life.
