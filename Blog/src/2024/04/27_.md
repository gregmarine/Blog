# Arboretum Day

Happy Arboretum Day!!! Yay!!! The day is finally here! For those who aren't me or Ch√©rie, her and I planned a day where she went to the arboretum near her in California and I went to a botanical gardens in Florida near me. While at each, we did a FaceTime video call to share in each other's experiences. A virtual walk through the park, if you will. I've not done anything quite like that before. I've video chatted several times. But go somewhere, each of us in a different location, to do a shared experienced, this was new and exciting! I would definitely love to do more such experiences.

I went to the Nature Coast Botanical Gardens for my half of the experience. It's a nice little place. With an emphasis on *little*, that meant I was able to walk through the entire garden a few times to her once loop around the arboretum...hehehe But that's okay. If we do this particular thing again, I may go to the Sunken Gardens in St. Pete. It's a bit larger and has a lot more to show. For this being a first time experience, I'm still quite happy with my choice of gardens. Just as I was leaving the gardens, I became a panda...LOL
