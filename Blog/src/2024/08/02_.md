# TBD

I’ve been finding it more and more difficult to engage on social media as of late.

I’m still able to post when I feel inspired. But I’m struggling to engage on content I see from others. I’m seeing far less content that draws me into the conversation.

I almost need to reset my brain to 4 years ago when socials became an important part of my life so I can start seeing things again.

Have I changed? Have others? Am I in a melancholy state now? Socially speaking. I’m otherwise quite happy.



Perhaps that’s part of it. I do see a lot of divisive posting. I avoid those things, actually.

But I’m also thinking about my own personal point of view on content I use to actively engage with.

William: Well then, reach deep down within and find the source of your disengagement. Seems the observations were rhetorical




Yes, I feel normal and I’m okay with this. It’ll be interesting where this leads ❤️

It’s also happening offline with in person social interactions. I just need to avoid isolation. I, like all humans, am wired for community.




I appreciate you, Mark 🙌

This is only a season. Just starting the conversation has opened my heart and mind to possible root causes for what I’m currently experiencing.





Yeah, this feeling seems normal. I’m definitely going with it for now and see where it takes me ☺️

I’m beginning to feel this way offline as well. With my living alone, I need to at least engage socially enough to avoid completely disconnecting from reality 😆







I’ve been struggling with community online and offline this year. I’m okay with that because this is only a season. Twitter is where I connected the most. But lately, I’ve been disconnected there as well. I’m going to keep going with the flow and see where it takes me. I look forward to what I’ll learn for now and how it makes me grow 🤗




I’m going to ride this feeling out. It’s only for a season. Upon meditating on this since yesterday, I’ve realized I’ve disengaged socially offline as well. I’m happy and I’m glad the world is passing me by. I just want to avoid isolation. This is going to take effort on my part and I’ll gladly do so. I have lots of love to give.
Thank you for the hugs. I like warm hugs 🤗





As I meditated on this, I noticed I’m doing the same socially offline as well. I’ll go with this flow and see where it takes me. It’s just for a season and I’ll grow from this. I just need to avoid isolation 



Growing pains…I think that’s what I’m experiencing. I appreciate what you said because I hadn’t looked at it quite like that. Thank you 




The world, it’s a mess 😆 I’m just going through a season. I’ll go with the ebbs and flows and see where it takes me. I’m struggling with offline social interactions as well. I just need to avoid isolation 



I'm realizing this is also occurring offline. I've disengaged socially everywhere. But talking about it has already helped. I'm going to be journaling about it today, I think. Writing helps me process these things. And talking about it helps me see other perspectives. I believe part of what has happened is that I'm finding happiness in my loneliness. Drawing closer to Jesus through the process has been a good thing. But I also recognize that God created community for a reason. I'm grateful things like this are only for a season. Where I lack God pours out His Spirit. I'm looking forward to His process. That process is far greater than my progress. He has a plan for all of this.
