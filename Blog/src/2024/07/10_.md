# TBD

I'm a bit tired today...hehehe I did not sleep well last night. I kept dreaming about California. I woke up in the middle of the night around 3:14am; which would have been around 12:14am in California. I'm not really on California time right now, though. I got up to go to bathroom...LOL As for the poor sleep. Well, I think that was due to the anxiety of yesterday. So it's explainable...hehehe

I almost fell asleep during a meeting...oops! But speaking of work, it has been a low key kind of week. The transition to the new company has been going smoothly. Not stressful whatsoever. There are a few more events left with that for this month. There are also some out in the future later this year and into next year. It's a slow process. But I think that makes things a little better. For me at least...hehehe

I have a few new responsibilities now. Nothing too big yet. They aren't full on projects. I'm hoping to get some big projects soon. I am one who tends to thrive on the big stuff. I get excited and dive right on in. When I'm doing simple tasks, I often feel like I'm not doing enough for the company. But I'm reminded that I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing...hehehe

I haven't gone back to social media yet. I do get on there to check in on what a few folks are posting. But I don't scroll for long. When I was on my trip, I didn't feel like posting anything. I was living in the moment. But now that I'm back to my routine, I haven't gotten up to speed with that part yet. Honestly, I don't miss it much...hehehe I suppose if I get bored, I'll get back into the habit of scrolling more...LOL In the meantime, I'll keep checking out the latest for the few I feel drawn to keep up with...hehehe

The weather has been a bit dreary since I've been back. I think the sun has come out a couple of times. But it wasn't at a time I could go outside and enjoy it. Yesterday's *warm hug* photo sort of had some sunlight. But it was filtered through cloud cover and wasn't direct. But that's okay. The sun will come out eventually. That's how it works in Florida. Most of the time, we have sun. Hence the nickname *The Sunshine State*. Plus, I had plenty of sun in California...hehehe

It has been a bit muggy, though. My air conditioner has been running quite a bit the last few days as a result. That's to be expected, though. That's the climate here and I like a little heat and humidity. Most people don't seem to like that. I don't blame them. I think I'm a bit odd with that. I'm also okay when it isn't a little warm and muggy. I'm very flexible when it comes to these things now. I have my preferences. But I can adapt as needed. I recall when my sister stayed with me for a month that I kept the place cooler for her. I simply added a layer of clothing. My electric bill has never been high here...hehehe
