I slept well last night. Although, my sleep tracker claims I was awake for 18 minutes in the middle of the night...LOL I don't recall having been. I do recall going to the bathroom. Just not being actively awake for very long. I also woke from a dream when my white noise app stopped. I'm not normally in a REM phase at that time. So, it felt like a disruption in sleep. But that's okay. My morning prayer time set me back on track...hehehe

I haven't spoken much about food lately. I'm not really on a specific diet any longer. However, I still eat a lot of the same food I did when I was doing the pescatarian diet. I do have some chicken, though. And when I eat out, I sometimes get beef, pork, and chicken. But I'd say the majority of what I eat remains in the vegetarian and seafood realm. There isn't any particular reason other than that's what I continue to crave.

With the exception of possibly eating out a lot next week on my trip, I think I'm going to cut back or cut out eating out for a while. I don't know if it that it's I do it too much, or something else, but it does not satisfy the same desires it used to. Sometimes I'd eat out just to be around people. Other times, it was for the ambience. And, of course, I do enjoy the food at my favorite restaurants. But lately, I've just not been feeling any of it. So, I think it is time to take a break from it. I still eat at home quite a bit. I'm just thinking I'd like to go back to eating at home for every meal. I may still go out when I'm out with a friend or family. Just special occasions instead of the casual thing it has become.

Social media has become less of a thing in my life. I sometimes find myself scrolling out of habit...hehehe I don't post nearly as much and I still don't see a lot of things from people I follow that I engage with. I don't give it much thought anymore, though. It is simply something that is there when I'm bored, I guess. When I do post, it is meaningful. When I engage with others, it is meaningful as well. I do find myself beginning to engage with other's posts and then canceling out. Social media had become a very important part of my life and personality for a few years beginning with the pandemic in 2020. This year, it has sort of fallen back into what it was before. Except this time, I do miss some of the interactions I had with friends. Maybe those interactions will come back after this election cycle. Part of my current lack of motivation is all the political stuff...LOL Actively ignoring posts can be exhausting...LOL
