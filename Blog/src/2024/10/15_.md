One of the main things I prayed about yesterday was how I tend to overthink. Realizing how I overthink most things might have been caused by past trauma, I am ready to let that go. Overthinking has never served me well...hehehe This is not to be confused with thinking things through. It is wise to consider things from multiple angles to form a good opinion or conclusion. I'm referring more so to the spiral my mind has gone through when obsessing over an event that has occurred or one that is coming up. Or projecting how I feel about myself onto the thoughts I think other people are thinking about me. Not to mentioned thinking about what people actually do or say to me that makes an impact on what or how I think about myself or the world around me. And so on and so on...yeah, overthinking. I'm not really describing the experience well here. However, if you are also an overthinker, you know what I'm talking about.

This led me back to:

::: details Philippians 4:4-8
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 5 Let your gentleness be apparent to all. The Lord is near.

6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think on these things.

On my morning walk this morning, I meditated on this passage. Yesterday, I was able to turn off the overthinking. So today, I wanted to start my day off with thoughts of what is true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and praiseworthy. In doing so, my hope was that I wouldn't have to turn off the overthinking. That is to say, I would not have been overthinking anything in the first place...LOL And to a degree, this has worked so far today.

Today's *Vitamin G* was based on this passage: *What I think about is just as important as how or why I think about anything <3*

I began to overthink the post...LOL I wanted to say more. But I applied what I learned yesterday to this. I decided to keep it simple. Because it really is that simple. I'm not saying it is easy, though. It's hard to undo years of bad programming. It's hard to unlearned bad behaviors. It's hard to change. But, it is very simple.
