Good morning! And welcome to another day with meeeeeee! LOL (in Budford's voice, of course...hehehe)

I slept well last night. With the exception of one trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I didn't wake until my white noise turned off. I probably could have slept longer had I set that to go longer. But that's perfectly fine. I feel really well this morning.

I'm looking forward to the new day. Besides work, I really don't know what is in store today. That's the case most days lately. Without a specific routine and a *what are we going to do today* focus, I have no expectations for my days right now...hehehe
