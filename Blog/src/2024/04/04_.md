# TBD

When I look at what I wrote yesterday, besides a typo or two, I see an incomplete thought. It seems there is more to what I was saying than what I actually said...hehehe On one hand, it seems like a complex idea. On the other, why make it so complicated? Is my overthinking nature getting the best of me? Most likely, yes. But that's okay. The whole point of this journal is the document my journey. Not the destination. Where I am going will be there when I get there. Until then, I can ramble on and on while trying to make sense of everything...HA!
