## Social Media

Social media is a funny thing. So much of society seems to revolve around it lately. There's both good and bad with that. And that's okay. Lately, I'm realizing a few things. For me, I have evolved to be an encourager. And today I had a thought about that. I'm not meant to help everyone. In some ways, I'm not really meant to help anyone. I think my purpose on social media is to just be *me*. If someone finds help in what I post, that makes my heart happy. However, if no one finds help, should my heart be unhappy? Absolutely not...hehehe That's because it isn't about me. I'm not one to post with the motivation of, *oh look at me doing this thing, eating that thing, or this is what I think*. My motivation is really more like, *this is me*. Yep, that's it! It's really that simple. I have nothing to *sell* anyone. I am who I am. How people react or respond to me really isn't about me, though. That's about them. So why should I concern myself with likes, comments, or reposts? I feel it is okay for me to be happy when all of that happens. I just need to be okay when it doesn't happen.

One of the reasons I started thinking about this is because I pondered how my Twitter account grew. As of late, it has stopped growing. I get fewer and fewer likes, comments, and the reposts have pretty much ceased. In 2020, I had about 25 followers. Today, I have 2.7k. When my account was growing, it was during a time when I was highly engaged. Not only was I posting, I would comment on posts and follow people I found interesting. This year, I've slowed down quite a bit with all of that. I stopped following new accounts for the most part and I've actually started unfollowing. I don't comment as much either. I'm less engaged because the content has become less engaging for me. I'm not sure if people have changed or if it is the algorithm that changed. I never scroll through the *for you* feeds anymore. I only ever did that by accident anyway. Once I learned that feed existed, I now consciously switch over to *following* or my own private feed on Twitter. On IG, I have the *following* and the *favorites* feeds. Threads just has the *following* feed. They don't seem to have favorites yet. And Facebook hasn't really changed anything in quite a while...LOL

Something else I've noticed as a result of having met so many of my social media friends in person these last 4 years is how *fake* a lot of folks are. They have a persona on socials that they do not exhibit in person. I actively try to be the same person online as I am offline; with a few exceptions...more on that later. Just today, I noticed someone posted something that was contrary to the last time I hung out with them in person. I suppose things can change. But I also think it is human nature to put our best face forward publicly while we struggle in private. Since what I know is private, I'll just say that the context I'm speaking of here is to actually say I question how genuine a person is online versus the truth they show in offline.

This brings me back to myself. For the most part, I'm really close to being the same person offline as I am online. There are two main exceptions to this. The first is that I do not post private details. Why would I?! Why does anyone?..LOL I'm referring to things like what I would only talk to my closest friends about. Case in point, I'd never publicly discuss how lonely I am sometimes. The second exception is that I don't always engage with people offline in the way I do online. I'm more shy at first until I get comfortable with someone. I can stand in front of a crowd and be Mr. Personality. But one-on-one is more of a challenge.

I'm mostly just rambling on here. Some of what I originally wrote was more of a rant. I'm working on writing with a more positive attitude. So I'm glad I'm writing about this topic today. It gave me an opportunity to put into practice one of the many things God is working on in my heart. No one will ever see the rant I wrote...hehehe But here we get to see the result of processing my thoughts using the new lens God is polishing in my heart. My conclusion? Perhaps social media is like going to a party, meetup, or a reunion. Some folks will just pretend all is going great to make themselves look and feel better about what is really going on in their lives. Whereas I will just continue being authentic and genuine. I'll just be *me* and not worry about how people will respond or react...or if they'll just ignore me...LOL Worrying about all that won't make people like me. But the worry might take away from liking myself. Since my motivation isn't about likes, comments, or reposts, I'll just be happy I have somewhere to express myself. When it does help someone, my heart will be happy. When it doesn't, I'll be okay with that.
