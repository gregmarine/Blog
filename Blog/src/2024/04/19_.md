## Favorite Moment

For the past week or so, I've been contemplating what my favorite moment has been each day. I even asked a few of my closest friends the question, *What was your favorite moment today*? I may continue doing this for the forseeable future. Both for myself, and for those I'm closet to. Perhaps not every day. But often enough for it to make an impact on our lives.

On social media today, my *Vitamin G* post posed the question, *What was your favorite moment this week*? Great or small, and regardless of whether we'd consider this a good week or not, finding our favorite moment seems important. I then challenged my *followers* to share the story of their favorite moment with someone they care about.
