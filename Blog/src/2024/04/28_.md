# TBD

Well, today has been a bit...different...hehehe I do believe I might be sick...LOL I haven't been ill with a bug in 5 years. At least not to my knowledge. I ended up staying home from church today just in case. It feels kind of like a cold. I'm not entire sure since it has been so long since I've caught a bug. I'm definitely one who stays home when this happens. I cannot bear the thought of spreading anything. I'm also one who can take care of himself. I'm not the typical guy who acts like being sick is anything remotely like dying. I still got up at my normal time and went about my routine. Albeit, at a slightly slower pace. I am very weak, though. I wasn't able to stand the entire time through 2 worship services today. I had to sit down on the couch part way through both worship times. And sadly, I fell asleep during Pastor Raul's sermon today. After that service, I laid down for a nap and slept a little over an hour.

Today's *The Chosen: Book One* devotion (*Day 3: Represent*), was very thought provoking. I spent hours processing and writing about it. I'm glad it fell on a Sunday...hehehe I had extra time to devote to it.
