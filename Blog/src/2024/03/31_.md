## Food for Thought

In my last [Food for Thought](./25_buckwheat-bread-food-for-thought-and-330-am#food-for-thought) reflection, I explored a possible healthy attachment I had between my paternal grandfather and coffee. I also decided my next exploration on the topic of attaching people, places, and things to certain emotions would likely be about a not so healthy attachment.

When I would visit Indiana after my move to Florida, I typically dreaded the journey. One of the many reasons I left Indiana was due to how all of the trauma I experienced occurred in the mid-west. It isn't the mid-west specifically. Just that it all happened to take place up there. So there are a lot of people, places, and things up there I just don't want to see anymore!

All of that has been a set of triggers for me that not only brought back memories, it would also cause flare ups of the anxiety and depression I suffer from. It could be something as simple as a vehicle that resembled what my abuser drove, or it could be going near a location where the abuse took place. In the case of the vehicle, I would begin to entertain thoughts that the person was stalking me to reengage in the abuse. And when I did actually see some of those people, I would definitely have a flare up! Having the abuse happened to me multiple times by multiple people meant I just had to get out of Indiana.

On my last trip in December 2023, something was different. I had spoken with several friends about my nearly paralyzing fear of going back to Indiana for my Christmas visit. They then prayed for me and my trip. When I initially cross the border into Indiana, I did have a brief moment where I had slight anxiety. But I didn't allow it to control me this time. I controlled it. I realized I could either continue to allow the past trauma to torment me, or I could tell that trauma just how big my God is!

I spent about a week up there and saw several things that normally trigger me. But none of it had any impact on me this time. I dismissed every single trigger. I didn't want to continue living in fear every time I journeyed up there. Indiana will likely be in my life for the remainder of my time on earth. So it was time for this triggers to stop causing flare ups.

All of those people, places, and things in the mid-west were unhealthy attaches to feelings of fear, shame, and guilt. Anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts were always the result of allowing those triggers to affect me.
