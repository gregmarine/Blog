I feel fortunate to have grown up in a time when church still sang hymns. Today's modern worship is all well and good. But it all feels more like a performance these days. If that is how someone does worship, that's great. It just isn't how I worship. Hymns have done a better job of helping me express what is on my heart. Modern songs are fun and I do enjoy them. I just don't always relate to them. There are some songs today that I still connect to, though.

I sometimes wonder what the early church was like. Did they have some sort of praise and worship music? Did they recite the Psalms? Did they have sermons? Did they collect an offering? What was that early church truly like? All rhetorical, of course. The Bible does talk a little about it. It all leads me to believe church is in our hearts. That is where God lives within us. And fellowship helps us remain engaged in a our spiritual wellbeing. It is a healthy way to live out our faith. How that looks or how it's implemented can come in many forms.

I've been out of the physical church since the first week of July.
