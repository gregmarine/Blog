# Workcation

Another journal entry when the title came before writing...LOL I'm on a workcation...hehehe It isn't quite a vacation. It isn't quite a staycation. And it definitely isn't a naycation. I'm working from Disney World while also enjoying the amenities of the vacation capital of the world...hehehe

The room's coffee maker makes horrible coffee. So I made a quick trip to the food court to get a decent cup of coffee. I found a window of opportunity between rain showers. The impact of the storm is upon us here. It hasn't been bad yet. I actually don't know that it will ever get too bad here in central Florida. At least out of the ordinary for this area in this season of the year. The hurricane remains out in the gulf. The eye of the storm will not be passing over Disney World.

My workload is actually pretty light right now. Other people on my team seem to have heavier workloads than I do. However, they aren't the sort of tasks that can be shared with the likes of me. So, I'll just stick to my tasks and do my best not to worry about how others are doing on my team.

It's raining pretty heavy at the moment (9:45am). But the wind isn't bad. So, it seems like the typical rain shower for here. That said, it is definitely one of the bands of rain from the hurricane. I love watching the rain. I have the curtain opened to watch it...hehehe Unfortunately, people keep walking by and looking in...LOL When I walk by a hotel room's window, I look straight ahead. I don't want to look inside rooms...LOL

The hurricane is a category 2 now. The current predictions are now showing that it will be a 3 before landfall. Last night, it was looking like it might become a category 4 by then. Regardless, where it makes landfall will get devastated. My heart aches for those folks. Even if they get out of the way of the storm, they'll be going home to a disaster. The wind has picked up by a lot here now (9:55am). They storms are amazingly and beautifully dangerous. They must be respected.

I love Florida. Most of the time, there isn't anything to be concerned about. Storms pop up during this season. And on occasion there are these massive hurricanes. But for the most part, it is a lovely place to live. That said, I do question myself during these storms...LOL

The rain and wind are letting up now (10:00am). As you can see by the timestamps I included, a lot can change in 15 minutes...LOL

I'm hoping to be able to make it to one of the parks for lunch today. There should be a break in the weather long enough for me to do so. I think it'll be fun to take advantage of where I am. It'll be an experience I'll not forget. I might as well enjoy it for what it is while I'm living it...hehehe

I was able to make it to Animal Kingdom for lunch. I had a craving for Yak & Yeti, a nice restaurant at AK. They didn't have any lunch openings for reservations. But they do have a small bar and there is a *walk-up* option if available when you arrive. I figured I might be able to get in being solo. When I arrived, the bar was full. But the walk-up list was available. At first, it said a 10 min wait. Once I signed up, that jumped up to 55 mins with an apology...LOL I waited by the bar just in case someone were to leave. Less than 10 mins later, my walk-up reservation was called...LOL So, I ended up with a table within 10 mins after all...LOL

It was such a lovely meal and I had a wonderful time. I went with suggestions the Cast who served me mentioned for both my drink and entrée. The drink was some sort of passion fruit lemonade. It was delicious! It was sort of like a mocktail, I suppose. The entrée was something called a Dragon Bowl, I think. It was like a sushi roll but as bowl instead. Deconstructed sushi? It had all sorts of proteins in it. It was a perfect lunch. I also got a mango pie for dessert. I didn't take any photos of my food. But I did take plenty of my surroundings to always remember it by. I also took a short video to record the ambience.

At the end of my meal and after I paid, I asked them what I could pray about on their behalf. They mentioned the song *More Than Able* by Elevation Worship had been on their heart these past three days. So, they asked if I would pray that song over them. I invited a few of my friends and family to pray with me for them as well.

After that, I went over to the Safari to enjoy some animals before heading back to the hotel. The animals were pretty active considering the approaching hurricane...LOL I'm so glad I took the time to do the Safari. It was a literal walk-on. All of the folks I was walking in line with from the entrance and I got right into one of the trucks when we arrive at the loading dock...LOL

On my way back to the hotel is when I reached out to friends and family to pray for me new Yak & Yeti friend...hehehe One of them is a neighbor of mine who stayed home. We got to chatting about the scripture they are looking to as they ride out the storm. I think our conversation was an encouragement to them. They did some lovely drawings to help express their concerns about the storm as sort of a prayer to God.
