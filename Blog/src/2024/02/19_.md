## Little Orphant Allie

I had one of the strangest dreams this morning. I had dreamt I wrote about my *very small* connection to Little Orphan Annie. And here I am writing about it!

I grew up hearing about one of my distant cousins from a very long time ago. James Whitcomb Riley was a renowned writer and poet from the mid-19th century through the early 20th century who was known for writing children's stories and love poems. My small connection to him is that his mother was a Marine by birth.

He wrote a poem originally published in an Indianapolis news paper by the name of *The Elf Child* and later renamed it to *Little Orphant Allie*. However, due to a typo, the title was actually published at *Little Orphant Annie*. Riley wanted to have it corrected but ended up keeping the new name.

The name *Allie* was named after a bound servant in his childhood home by the name of Mary Alice "Allie" Smith and the poem was about the stories she would tell Riley and his siblings when they were children. The moral of the stories, and the poem, was to mind your parents...hehehe

It was later adapted into a comic strip, where it was then changed to *Little Orphan Annie*, into a few movies, and a Broadway musical. That musical was eventual adapted into a film in 1982 named *Annie*. At the young age of 4, I went to see that film in the theater.

Little than I knew then that I was in a small way tied to that movie and its rich history dating all the way back to 1885 when *The Elf Child* was published. There is a phonograph recording of my late cousin reciting the poem. It's in a old Hoosier dialect from the state I'm from, Indiana. I may record myself reciting it someday. I think it would be pretty cool since he is in my family tree. Being so fond of how things *were supposed to be*, I may title it *Little Orphant Allie* in honor of Mary Alice "Allie" Smith as James Whitcomb Riley originally intended. Then again, he did accept the typo...hehehe

As a side note, his tomb is at the highest point in Indiana. He was laid to rest in Crown Hill Cemetery. The tomb is at the crest of Crown Hill and casts a shadow on the tombs of even a President of the United States...hehehe He's a very important part of Hoosier history as well as my family history. There's a children's hospital named in his honor as well. He's going to live forever...LOL
