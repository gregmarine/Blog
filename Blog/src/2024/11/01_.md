# TBD

Happy November!!! Can you believe I've been journaling here for 10 full months now?!? There are only two months left in this great year. What'll happen next!?! hehehe

I've been reflecting on the lessons I was taught and the blessing that were brought in October. Some of the lessons were blessings and some of the blessings were lessons...LOL Not everything that happened would have been something I'd hope for. But with the heart God is creating in me, I feel really good about everything.

I went through a few hurricanes. I met some new friends. Some of those new friends are now moving away. A few existing friends are also moving. I had a nice visit with my parents and I've seen my sister more in the last month than I did the previous months. I took a small break from virtual church and now I'm planning to be back in physical church in a few weeks. I learned more about listening for God's voice and learned there is still quite a bit I don't know or understand about life. I reevaluated my current role as a father and realized how my parents parented me at my son's age isn't how I should be parenting him. Life has become a splendid misery of sorts...LOL

November should be off to a great start. I've wrapped up work for the week, as it is FriYAY! Tomorrow, I take flight for California!!! First order of business, DISNEYLAND and DCA!!! Woohoo!!! The way the vibe has been described to me, it sounds like DLR is more my speed. I'm setting my expectations at a reasonable level, though. I've learned to expect nothing and appreciate everything for what it is. I'll be doing that for this experience.

I'm working Monday through Thursday from the little apartment I'm renting. It will be a little odd considering the timezone difference. It'll be breakfast time in California when it is lunchtime here. I'll be done with work for the day in the afternoon instead of the evening. It will be getting dark for the evening early. The time change occurs on Sunday. Falling back an hour means the sun sets a little before 5pm next week. So, only a few hours after work ends.

On Friday, I'll have a magical day with Cherie!!! Yay!!! My plans to be in California the first week of November were because of this exciting Disney day with her. My trip in July worked out to include time with her. And that was a blessing. This time, the trip was specifically so that we could spend time together. Especially at Disneyland and DCA. The rest of the week, I planned around that. So, a little opposite to what I did in July...hehehe

I'm really excited for our Disney day! We have planned to wear matching outfits. It will be somewhat a personal dapper day for the two of us. Disney experiences have been extra special for us since September last year. This day will be extra special because we'll get to experience it in person.

As excited as I am, I'm not setting my expectations out of reach. I'm still applying the *expect nothing, appreciate everything* mantra. The *specialness* of the day is because I'm sharing it with Cherie. Everything that actually happens that day will be a plus on top of that. Also, the special bond we have is because it is a true friendship. In a way, we are *soulmates*. God placed us in each others lives at just the right moment. Ours is a friendship built on the foundation of Jesus. We are special because He makes us special. He created this friendship. And we are blessed to be in it. That's pretty special to me...hehehe
