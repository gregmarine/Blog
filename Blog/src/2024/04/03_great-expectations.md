# Great Expectations

Today, I'd like to talk about expectations and how they relate to how I respond to my world. As I mentioned yesterday, I've been experiencing some sadness this week. And I also mentioned how I find it difficult to trust people with my feelings. When I strip away the circumstances (people, places, and things), I'm left with only my expectations. Do those expectations have a direct correlation to my feelings? Let's find out...hehehe

I'm not going to go in depth into any specific circumstance here. I don't feel it is necessary to do so. But perhaps I'll use some high level examples along the way that draw from my own experiences?

I have found that I set a certain level of expectation in my own mind about certain things. Take a movie or TV show for example. I'll watch the previews and get in my mind of how well I'll like the show. I think previews are designed for that very purpose. They are to entice me to go watch whatever it is. If I set my expectations too high and the show does not quite meet what I think it should be for me, then I'm left with disappointment. If I set my expectations too low and the show is outperforms those expectations, then I'm left not only feeling fulfilled in my decision to see the show, I might actually think it is far better than it really is.

The same can be said about the places I go to. Often times I'll set a level of expectation in my mind about what I'll experience when I'm planning a trip somewhere new. If I have to travel far or if it will cost a significant amount, I really want that place to delivery an experience well worth the cost or travel time. If the experience is far better than I expected, great! However, when if falls short, those *bad* experiences can leave me with a bad impression of where I've been.

When it comes to people, I think I do the same thing. But with people, things get a little more complicated. With places and things, it's typically about what I can get out of those things or experiences. That isn't the case with people. I have to set my expectations not only for them, but also more so of myself. It isn't about what I can get out of my interactions with them. I must also consider what they get out of their interactions with me.

To further complicate matters, it isn't just about our interactions. There are elements such as what the other person may be thinking. How will they react to something I'm doing? How should I react to something they are doing? Do they have noble intentions? Do I have noble intentions? How do we feel in that moment? Are they having a bad day? Am I having a bad day? So many factors to consider when setting expectations that it can become overwhelming. And this is only scratching the surface of the complexities of being human.





I get it in my head about what they are thinking based solely on how I think about things. I cannot possible know what they are thinking. They have to tell me. And if they don't, I can't expect to know what they are actually thinking.


Share what my expectations are to give them the opportunity to accept the responsibility or not.

Ask clarifying questions to understand what my expectations should be.

I'm resetting everything...no longer basing on my previous experiences...learning from those experiences...but not expecting things to be like they were.
