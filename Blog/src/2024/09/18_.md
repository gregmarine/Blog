# TBD

I found yet another way *not* to make an omelette today. What I ended up with was a batch of really good scrambled eggs...LOL I think I'm having trouble due to my pan. I'm doing all of the things I see in videos and described in articles. But I cannot get it right. And I'm not getting consistent results. I have a single egg pan I use for sunny side eggs I put on sandwiches and in ramen or rice bowls. It works perfect every time. I think my larger pan, the one I'm using for omelettes and scrambled eggs, is what is causing my eggs to stick. I'll keep trying and I may buy a new pan someday.

This morning's prayer walk was amazing. The weather was perfect for being outside. I saw the same gal three times walking her *puppy*. The dog reminded me of the one Cherie is watching right now. White and fluffy...hehehe And the gal reminds me of Cherie as well. Short with glasses. I don't know her personally. So I'm speaking of appearance and not personality. She did respond well to my three greetings. I imagine she is a nice person :)

Today's devotional was a continuation of the *don't worry* topic. It talks about God providing. I'm glad I didn't publish all that I wrote yesterday about this topic. Part of what I wrote was along the same lines as today's devotional but could use more thought. So, I definitely want to give it more thought and prayer before I finish writing those thoughts.

One thing that stood out from today's that I hadn't really thought about before was why God provides what we need, beyond the fact He loves us. The quote I chose today was...

>  *The Chosen* book 4, pg 115 - God provides so that we can do the work He's calling us to do.

This comes from 2 Corinthians 9:8...

> And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.

I've only ever really thought about His provisions as what I needed to live each day. However, I can see how it would be good to look past my needs to deeper into my purpose. I'm truly trying to trust Him with my journey. Which means my journey is not really my own. So, what He provides me really isn't even about my needs. Perhaps, it is more about what He wants to do with my life?

That's as deep as I'll go with that thought for today. But I think I should explore this more. I'll certainly be praying about wisdom concerning how I use the resources He has Blessed me with. He has good work to do in my life. I want to make myself available for Him to do that good work. I don't want to get in His way...hehehe

I just discovered, today is my half birthday...LOL I've never really thought about it before...hehehe This year is a little different. Now that Cherie inspired me to experience my personal year as it starts on my birthday, I'm starting to pay more attention to when things fall in relation to my personal year instead of the calendar year. Today, I'm half way through 47, as I'm 46 now and will be 47 in March.

These past six months have gone really well overall. I've experience so much growth. I've also experienced change. I've lost some friends while at the same time growing closer to others. My relationship with God is quite a bit stronger. And my health continues to improve.

I have some major decisions to make over the course of the next six months. The biggest one is the one I've talked about recently considering where I live. I have others that I don't talk about here. These next months should continue to see personal growth. I'm looking forward to how things will turn out when I complete this personal year in March.

For my evening walk, I decided after the first mile that I'd jog the second. I ended up running the full second mile without a walk break. It felt incredible! I followed that up with another mile of walking. For the day, I walked four miles and jogged one for a total of five miles. During walking, I mostly prayed. Although I also prayed while I ran, I ended the mile reciting scripture. It was interesting being able to focus on that while my body was busy exercising. I'm really enjoying this new routine. And adding the jog mile was quite nice.

I'm watching the Dodgers game again tonight. So far, they are doing really well. I hope they keep up this momentum for the rest of the game...hehehe I enjoy watching the games far more than simply watching stats on the phone. I'm still not sure I'd be willing to buy the game package to watch most of the games next season. I'm not sure how many games I'd be able to commit to watching. But I can also multitask and do things while the games are on. So, maybe...LOL
