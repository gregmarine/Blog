## Arcadia’s Tears

As I alluded to a week ago, sleep has been a challenge and a struggle for most of my life. I suppose it had a lot to do with my anxiety. I would always be worried about something or someone. Even when I would sleep, I'd toss and turn all through the night thinking about whatever it was causing my anxiety. I was even on medication for this problem for a season. The medication was a controlled substance and actually had a street version. I never did seek out that street version, but for years I was never without that prescription! And as a controlled substance, it was highly addictive!

Although I was also seeking counseling for my anxiety, that medication was a welcome crutch at the time. The sad thing, the medical industry in the USA seems to have no issue prescribing medications for just about everything. This is usually in lieu of getting to the root of the problem. What I've chosen to do with medication is only rely on it to relieve the symptoms long enough to get right down to those roots. I never want to be dependant on medication. At one point with the aforementioned medication, I most certainly did not enjoy the fact that I was taking a controlled and highly addictive substance. The withdrawal I endured when I went off of it is nothing I would ever wish on my worst enemy! Talk about sleepless nights! The shaking, the scratching at my skin, the thought of wanting to open up my head and squish my brain! It was one of the most difficult challenges I have ever faced.

That was 14 years ago. And the crazy thing to me is now I sleep great. I still have anxiety. However, I deal with it in a health way now. I'll watch a funny movie. I'll take a long walk. I write poetry to express my emotions. Whatever it takes, I'll do something productive now. Last night, I wrote a poem to help me cope with the tragic loss of life in the small community of Arcadia, Florida, this week. Although I did not know these people, my friend Dan very much knew them. The teenager was one of Dan's students. I mentioned this tragedy yesterday in my blog entry. When my friends and family hurt, I hurt. So I wrote that poem. As soon as I posted on my Threads account, I fell right to sleep. No medication necessary! God has given me the gift of words. I'm grateful that I can express myself in these ways. Sometimes the words seem like nonsense to the average reader. But it means something to me. And it means something to someone else. I always hope it helps others. I may plant the seeds and water them, but God helps it grow. Here is that poem:

The eyes are all aglow
The words pour out as sweet wine
The heart yearns for better days 
The lips express the heart’s desire

A life is but a bittersweet presence
Here for but a moment
How much longer is the wait
Why can’t sweet relief be now

Sadness will not overcome
The night is for mourning
The morning is for celebration
The sun rises once more

Why struggle
Why fight
Find rest
Find peace
