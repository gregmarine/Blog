# Birthday Eve

I figure I should probably write a little tonight because I may not write anything tomorrow...hehehe Tomorrow is my BIRTHDAY!!!

I'm sure I wrote about this before, but I use to never celebrate my birthday. I hated the annual reminder that I was getting older. Not because of the *old* part. More like how adulting is hard work...hehehe I also didn't want to grow to become my dad! I love him dearly. But there is so much I don't want to be that he is...sorry dad!

Truth is, I'm not much like my dad. I'm more like my grandfather (his dad). Dad isn't a bad man and he was always a great provider for us when we were kids. He still takes care of mom. There are just some important things that I would never want to resemble in him. So I do the opposite...hehehe

Anyway, I really do love celebrating my birthday now. Last year, it was at Disney World. And since I wasn't able to work out a trip to Disneyland this year, I've decided to stick closer to home. I'll be having breakfast with Kerry in the morning after I've watch part of the Dodgers game. I'm also going to have dinner at Ford's Garage with that dining experience I think I may have mentioned before. If not, I just mentioned it now...hehehe

For the time in between those meals, I'm planning to explore a few botanical gardens just south of me. It appears it will be a cooler day but really sunny. Kind of like how it was today. I'm charging my camera batteries to prepare for taking lots of photos...hehehe I'll also have my iPhone to take some photos that I can share instantly. Some *warm hug* photos and *sit with me a minute, will you* videos will likely be coming *your* way...

I felt it would be nice to take some time and meditate while exploring a piece of Florida I have yet to see. I actually got the idea from Chérie. She is hoping to go to the arboretum near her next month. This inspired me to see if any such place existed near me. I found several promising places to check out. I may end up at a few tomorrow...hehehe

It has finally arrived! Spring has sprung! But winter is trying to hold on tight around here...LOL It was bitterly cold this morning. I had to put on my warm jacket and a wool cap to go outside for a sunrise photo. I was pretty frozen by the time I got back inside...hehehe It did warm up as the sun was shining brightly all day. But I was still wearing jeans on my walk this evening. I also only walked 2 miles. I was just too cold to get that last mile in this time. I prefer warmth. I moved to Florida for a reason, after all...LOL

I woke really early today. Long before my normal time. I was woken by a nose bleed...ugh! At first I thought it might be sinus drainage. Nope! It was red. I immediate jumped into action to stop the blood flow. I then proceeded to save the pillow case. None of the blood had the chance to soak into the pillow. And I quickly washed the pillow case by hand in the sink. Stain, and crisis, averted! I tossed the case in the dryer and laid back down.

I wanted to go back to sleep. I still had plenty of time to sleep before I needed to get up. That's when I felt God call me to pray. This has been happening more frequently of late. I wake up in the middle of the night and a specific person or situation would be on my heart. I then pray until I fall back to sleep. Today was a bit different. This time, I did not go back to sleep. What I was being called to pray over has been on my heart all day. So I have continued to pray for it all day.

This call to action type of prayer is new to me. It isn't unusual for me to pray in general. But these callings have been intense! Especially today; which included that nose bleed...hehehe As I was praying in that wee hour of the morning, I also felt called to be still and silent. In that stillness, I was led to Matthew 17:14-21.

The rest of the day has been quite the spiritual journey. I won't go into it much here. I'm actually still processing some of it. But some of it I included in my devotional reflection journal. Especially the one Chérie and I are doing together. And part of that one inspired today's Vitamin G post.
