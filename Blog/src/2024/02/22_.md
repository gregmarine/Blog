## Website

I've been giving my new website some thought. I like the way my blog is going. So far, it has just been a personal journal. I'll probably keep it that way. Any sort of *blog post* other than a journal entry can be considered an article and will just go on my writing site instead of this blog.

I've already established the art site. I just need to get busy moving my existing art pages from the old site to the new one. Then I can begin publishing the rest of my existing art and any new art as I create it.

I'll create a photography site to hold all of my photo content. I'll just publish low resolution copies of my photos. I may sell some photos someday. So I don't want to publish the original high resolution photos on that site. Plus I'd want to toss on a watermark for the ones I sell.

I'm not sure if I'll create a recipe and food site again. The last 2 iterations of my website have included recipes. I seem to have some interest from family and friends to have a *cookbook* of some sort. If I do that, I'll create such a site. But I'm not sure. It seems like a good idea. I'm just not good at writing down my recipes...LOL Then again, publishing them on a website would get me motivated to finally writing it all down...hehehe

As for my writing, I'm not quite sure what I'd call that part of my site. And I'm not sure if I'll lump it all together or make separate sub-sites. I have books, poems, haikus, and articles. Does all of that belong under a single umbrella? Or do I divide it up a little? Decisions, decisions...hehehe
