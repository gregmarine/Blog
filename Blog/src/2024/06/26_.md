Happy Stitch Day! Hehehe Today is one of those made up Disney holidays...LOL Stitch is experiment 626 in the *Lilo & Stitch* franchise. So June 26th became Stitch Day...HAHAHA He's one of Malachi's favorite characters. I think my nephews also have him as a favorite. And, my sister-in-law's birthday is today...hehehe Happy Birthday to her!

I use to have a business making Disney-inspired stuff using my 3D modeling and printing skills. If I ever do that again, I'll need to be sure to keep a calendar of all the Disney-inspired *holidays* and events to get people excited about my products...LOL Some of my favorite things I made back then were from *Lilo & Stitch*. I especially loved the hibiscus Mickey/Minnie ears I created...hehehe

Realizing I’m exactly where I am meant to be and I have exactly what I’m meant to have in this exact moment is a very freeing feeling.
