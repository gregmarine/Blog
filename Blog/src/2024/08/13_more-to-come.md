# More to Come

## New Port Richey

On Friday, my sister reached out to me to see if I wanted to hang out with her on Saturday. Since I rarely see her, I made myself available. I had wanted to be out and about on that day anyway. Having someone come along was an added bonus...hehehe When I got to her place, she asked what I wanted to do. I was interested in doing a *downtown* sort of day. My first thought was downtown  where she lives. In the conversation I had mentioned downtown New Port Richey. She had never been. So I offered the suggestion we go there instead. So we did...hehehe

NPR is one of the few places near me that I have considered as a possible place to move to next year. It seemed like a great idea to check out. I've been there a few times. My favorite Asian restaurant is there, actually. But besides that, I've only ever checked out the ice cream parlor. I hadn't ever just spent the day exploring it.

We were there for about 4 or 5 hours. We ate at that aforementioned restaurant, walked around Sims Park, checked out where a few apartment buildings were, had some ice cream, and walked up and down a few of the downtown streets. Everything we did was all within walking distance. It was quite lovely. At first it seemed like the sort of place I'd like to live. But then my sister pointed out that there were very few actual shops. Most of the businesses were eateries. She didn't really like it and I absorbed her vibe and started thinking it might not be a place I'd live after all.

Now that I'm a few days out from that adventure, I now recognize I was absorbing her vibe and not really making any thoughts of my own about what life in NPR might feel like for me...hehehe It's a place *she* would definitely not want to live. But what about *me*?..hehehe Although I do like to do shopping from time to time, eateries are definitely my thing...LOL I'm a foodie...LOL Plus, many of them have live music...hehehe Another one of my *things*...LOL They often do live music throughout the week. Not just on the weekends. So, I could pick a different place to eat each week, on say Tuesday, and enjoy a meal with live music. All the while enjoying home cooked meals most of the time. And I could enjoy that nice park. Which also has live music concerts at an ampitheater. And it looked like they have a movie night there too...hehehe

The more I think about it, NPR seems like my kind of place. I need to keep considering it. And I should probably check it out again by myself. I have this habit of feeling the vibes of others. While I welcome all input, I must feel things for myself when those things do not impact the other person...hehehe All of the things I liked about the downtown area were within walking distance of the two main apartment complexes. I could do all of those things without driving anywhere. That seems like *my* vibe.

## Happiness/Sadness Storm

Over the weekend, I was thinking about how I have been really focused on finding happiness in all areas of my life. That sounds like a good thing. But I got to wondering, if by doing so, was I suppressing other emotions by ignoring them? Just like two weather fronts can generate a storm when they collide, two opposing emotions have the potential of creating a storm in my soul.

In [my last journal entry](09_happy-friyay#sad-for-a-moment), I mentioned there was a moment of sadness that came over me. It happened a few more times throughout the weekend. The storm that manifested itself this time was relatively tame by comparison to struggles I've had in the past. I imagine my growth these past 4 years is making an impact on the severity of these emotional *storms*. And in addition to that growth, this year's journey with Jesus through my devotional time with Chérie is making an equally effective impact.

After I was pondering the storm analogy this morning, I opened up today's *The Chosen: Book 3, Day 30* devotional. Just as it has been quite often with these books, today's was directly related to what I'm experiencing in my life. The concept of the storm was the very subject of today's devotional. The disciples freaked out and questioned if Jesus cared they were going to perish in the storm because He was taking a nap...LOL He rebuked the storm and all became calm. Rather than answering their question, He took the opportunity to ask them why they were afraid. It was a teachable moment.

The storm I faced this past weekend did not frighten me. In fact, I responded on Sunday by taking a nap...LOL That's right, I literally took a nap. I sure wish I responded to all storms with such peace...hehehe That just so happened to be how I faced it this time. Today's devotional was reassurance about God's sovereignty over these things. I just need to trust in Him. I hope to always remember how I trusted Him this time; when I face my next storm. This one wasn't very big. But regardless how big a storm is, God is so much bigger...hehehe

## One Foot In

The Lord's Prayer, and passages like Matthew 6:33, remind me to have a Kingdom focus. But I also *live* in the world. I'm fine with living in the world and not being of it. I just need to remain in the mindset that I have one foot on earth while I also keep one foot in Heaven.

As the world and Heaven play *tug-of-war* with my soul, I can become a bit weary...hehehe Sometimes I feel like it is a bit much...LOL But then I remember that God is my strength. It only weighs on me when I forget that He is there doing the work. When I try to do the work, that's what wears me out...hehehe

I'm not a *control freak* when it comes to other people. However, when it comes to my own life, it seems as though I want control. Although I have control over my own choices, my life truly belongs to God. So, while I make choices that impact my life on earth, so long as I keep my Kingdom focus, I'll make the choices that work out best for my life. That's because God knows what is best. Keeping my eyes on Him will help me make those Kingdom focused choices.

::: details Matthew 6:9-13
9 So then, this is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. 10 Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’

33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.

## Food

I think I mentioned that I'm not really on a diet any longer. I pretty much eat whatever I want. And I focus what I want on clean ingredients. When I eat at a restaurant, I try to choose meals that have obvious ingredients. If they are listed on their website, I'll research it ahead of time as well.

I realized this month that ingredient lists are dictated by USA law...LOL The FDA does not have human health in mind...LOL Wow! Our system is truly messed up...LOL I keep laughing because it is well beyond my control. But honestly, it isn't a laughing matter.

I've decided I'm going to just trust God with this one. I'm going to stay away from the obviously bad stuff. If I'm not 100% sure, I'll just not worry about it anymore. Some countries have stricter laws about these things. Alas, I do not live in other countries...LOL

## North Carolina

My plans for NC are mostly set. At least as far as where I'm staying and who I am seeing...hehehe I'll be working Monday through Wednesday. I'll be arriving on Saturday. I'll do my grocery shopping on Saturday or Sunday. I only need food for a few days, though. Thursday and Friday will likely be *eat out* days as I'll be going to the coast one day and the mountains another day. Basically, I won't be *home* those 2 days...hehehe

Tyrese will be working the first half of the week as well. We are suppose to be meeting up Wednesday night to plan our time Thursday and Friday. She'll be working that following Saturday. So I'll be heading home that day.

This Sunday, and perhaps the evenings of Monday and Tuesday, I'll be exploring some parks and gardens in the area. I'm hoping to journal this trip like I did for California. But I'm not sure what all I'll journal on my work days. If I experience much in those evenings, I'll write about it most likely.

Since my main objective is to find a place to live, I find it important to journal these trips. I've imagined NC as a possible home for decades. California is a bit of surprise...hehehe And Florida is still on the table too...LOL

## Disney

I'm headed back to Disney this week...hehehe Originally, it was just to be Friday as a celebration of Corban's 31st birthday. I decided I'd head there Thursday night and stay at the French Quarter resort for a few nights. After work on Thursday, I'll head to Disney.

Aside from spending part of the day with Dan and Corban on Friday, I don't really have plans for this visit. There are some limited time shows going on that I may try to catch. But I'm not going to stress about trying to do that...hehehe The hotel isn't cheap. But I honestly love staying there from time to time. This is one of the few I've only been to once. I stayed there with my parents in May. So I wanted to try it again this time to really take it in.

When I was with them, I was more focused on their enjoyment than my own. They are doing really well. But they are reaching that age where I can't help but be focused on them when I'm with them...if that makes sense.

This past weekend had many announcements coming to the world of Disney...hehehe Many of the announcements were for changes to Disney World. I dropped off of social media because so many people were talking about it...LOL There is absolutely nothing wrong with people talking about it. In fact, there are a few people I love to hear what they have to say about it. But most of it was people just reposting the same announcements everyone else was. That's why I dropped off for a few days...hehehe Seeing the same exact post a dozen times really got old over the weekend. When I hopped back on briefly, there were a few posts where people made comments of their own without reposting the same announcements. I loved hearing the real thoughts from real people...LOL Chérie made a post. Hers was the type I actually love. She didn't repost a Disney announcement. She posted a real thought.

I personally like change. I like to see what they come up with. I just don't hold my breath on these announcements...hehehe I wait until real progress is being made. Some of the pre-pandemic announcements got me excited. Alas, they did not come to be. Some of the post-pandemic announcements are still yet to be realized as well. Once something actually comes to Disney, I'll give it a chance and my opinion.

I loved Splash Mountain. Just over 3 weeks ago, I finally had the opportunity to try Tiana's Bayou Adventure. I loved it too. So, whatever they end up doing with the parks after these announcements, I'll keep an open mind to what they come up with.

## Conclusion

I have a few more things to write about. But I just realized this is a bit long. I'll save the rest for another day...maybe tomorrow...hehehe More to come...LOL
