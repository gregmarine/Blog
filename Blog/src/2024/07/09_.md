# TBD

I'm *home*.

The *transition* back to my *normal* has been smooth. I suppose, preparing for the time zone difference in California was a wise decision...hehehe I've already had people comment on how surprised they are that I'm functioning today. I'm not experiencing jet lag whatsoever, actually. I didn't even rush to get to my coffee this morning. I think I may have even had it later than I usually do...hehehe Again, that's because I don't drink it for the caffeine anyway. It is more of a grounding mechanism for me. One that I'm considering letting go of.

I'm already continuing my reflection from my trip. Part of what God was talking to me about on the trip was how I treasure my friends and family, and whether I could give any of them up for the sake of following Jesus. Clearly, He isn't asking me to give any of them up. But what I do sense is that He wants me to let go of the importance I put on those relationships. To be clear, I'm not talking about their value. The relationships and the people I have them with are valuable by their own merits and as defined by God. I'm talking about the focus I put on the relationships. Sometimes, I put them before my relationship with God. That's pretty easy to do. For some, it's money, job, or anything tangible. For me, it's people.

There isn't any one person or relationship I'm referring to here. I'm speaking generally. I've been pondering if I might be an empath. I'm not even sure how one knows such a thing. I've always had empathy. But I clearly sense the mental and emotional state of those around me. I'm not even speaking physically around me. I keep having those moments when I reach out to someone because I have a sense that they need encouragement. And their response indicates perfect timing. As much as I believe that is the Holy Spirit prompting me, I also wonder if that is just part of who I am as a person? It could be a spiritual gift God has given me?
