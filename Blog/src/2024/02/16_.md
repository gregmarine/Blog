# TBD

## 8:05 am

Good morning! A new day! Same circumstances...hehehe I decided to take another mental health day. Between getting home late, and getting very little sleep as a result, and the fact I did not quite resolve what I was going through yesterday, I really felt like I needed another day away from my routine.

I love routine. So much so that when all is well in my world, breaking the routine can be a bit annoying...hehehe However, when I'm depressed, breaking the routine helps out in a way. I still did my prayer and daily refresh time to start my day. I also shaved and showed. Those few things are basically a must to jump start my day.

As tempting as it might be to go to Disney again today, I don't plan on it. Although it was good that I went yesterday, I feel as though it did not complete accomplish the goal I had yesterday. The only other thing I have planned today is a video chat with Ch√©rie that I'm very much looking forward to.

We've been chatting over text for nearly a year now. We originally met on Twitter. That's just about the only good thing about Twitter...LOL I'm still tempted to leave that place...LOLOLOL But we've haven't yet spoken over the phone or over a video call. I enjoy friendships like this. Not only does our friendship feel genuine, it feels easy; if that makes sense. Easy as in we can message each other all day some days. While others, we may not message each other at all but there isn't a feeling of *Is there anything wrong?!?*

It took me a while to ask her if we could talk over video. I had been considering it for a little over a month. I was slowly contemplating it because we live so far apart. The nice thing about texting is that it is asynchronous. I shoot off a message with no expectation that I'll get a reply quickly. It's just a matter of when we have the time to respond to each other. But a call or video requires planning and absolute focus for the moment. With our time zones being 3 hours difference, I didn't want to be an inconvenience for her.

That thought was a bit selfish of me. How could I possible know if it was inconvenient for her?!? Since our friendship is genuine, she'll have just as much time to focus in the moment as I do, right!?! So throwing all presumption aside, I finally asked her. Her response put a smile on my face...*Of course!* she said...hehehe And so we will be doing a video chat over Zoom this evening. Well, this afternoon for her...HAHAHA

Although texting will likely remain our main form of communication, I think video chatting will go well and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. She was such a huge blessing for my year last year. I want to grow the friendship this year. In my life, there are only a few friendships that have rooted and remain to this day. I imagine ours might do the same. The distance between us doesn't bother me one bit. And I hope to go out there to visit with her some time soon. Or should I say, soonish...I'm still waiting to see how this work situation pans out this year...hehehe

## 11:00 am

I definitely did not go to Disney today. I've also canceled any plans to go this weekend. Today, I just felt called to remain home. And for the weekend, the forecast shows rain most of the weekend. With the lower temps and rain, it doesn't sound like fun. The crowd levels should be lower as a result. But since I live about a two hour drive away, if I got tired of dealing with the rain and temps, it would seem like a waste of a drive. If I lived closer, I might risk it.

Right now, I'm pressing some tofu. I'm going to give air fried tofu a go for lunch today. One of the dishes I had last night was deep fried tofu. I liked the crispy texture to it. I have attempted air fried tofu before. It did not turn out. I hope I succeed today. I'm going to marinate it in coco aminos for about 15 minutes. I'll then toss it in cornstarch. I'll air fry at 375F for about 12 minutes.

I'll be making ramen with broccoli and carrots to go with the tofu. I'll probably through together a hot sauce to go with it all as well.

I've been watching the Marvel show *Echo* on Disney+. I tend to watch all of the Marvel shows. They are all connected. But this one has been a bit strange for me. The story doesn't really make much sense. I think I only have 1 episode left. Perhaps it will have more meaning when the next Marvel show or movie comes out. That is how these things have been going. Each show and movie is part of a greater whole. It can get exhausting following the stories. I have to recall past plots to see how they fit into new ones...hehehe

Tofu is ready to be cut and marinated. Fingers crossed I get it all to work out!

Although the tofu wasn't a disaster this time, it didn't work out quite like I'd hope. It wasn't very crispy. I think part of the problem was how I coated the cornstarch. I probably didn't press the tofu long enough either. So far, the best way I've been able to find to make tofu crispy on the outside is to sear them in ghee before cooking them in sauce.

Other than that, lunch tasted pretty good. I think I overcooked the ramen too. But again, it all tasted pretty good. The textures were the only thing a bit off. Although important, it didn't distract from the experience.

I finished *Echo*. It had a disappointing ending for me. But it does appear that it is leading into another show. Perhaps the new *Daredevil: Reborn* show that's coming.

I'm not sure what all else I'll be doing today. I may watch a little more TV. I have other shows to catch up on. I haven't been watching much TV lately. That feels pretty good.

I may also need to take a nap...hehehe
