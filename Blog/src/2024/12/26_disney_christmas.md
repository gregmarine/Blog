# Disney Christmas

Today is a doubleheader journal entry day...hehehe The other entry is a timestamp entry for my day. This one will be about my Disney Christmas yesterday. I failed to journal about Disney Thanksgiving. Which is perfectly fine. It wasn't my first time doing Disney for Thanksgiving. But this is my first Christmas at Disney. It is so special.

I went to bed *early* on Christmas Eve expecting that I'd want to get up early Christmas morning and *rope drop* Magic Kingdom. Early is relative. So, going to bed early just meant I wasn't going to stay up past midnight as I usually do. I think I was in bed by 10:30pm that night...hehehe So not that early for this timezone...LOL I think I was awake around 4am Christmas morning.

Being up that early was nice in that I didn't need to rush to get ready. I was able to do my morning routine, minus breakfast and coffee. I waited for those latter items for Disney...hehehe But I was able to do everything else at a nice pace. I was ready to walk out the door about 45 minutes before I needed to leave...hehehe

There wasn't any traffic to speak of on my way to Disney. That was to be expected. First of all, it was super early. Secondly, it was Christmas. There wouldn't have been the typical commuter traffic for those working in the Orlando area. I think it took about an hour and 45 minutes to get there using the back roads. I prefer the back roads for a few reasons. The back country of Florida is beautiful and it saves on fuel...hehehe

Arriving at Disney's Ticket and Transportation Center (TTC) so early meant I was able to get a great parking spot. It wasn't too far from security. I don't mind parking far now that I'm healthier. But I knew my day would be long and I'm glad I didn't have far to walk to get back my car after such a long day...hehehe

After I made it through security, I headed over to the Joffrey's kiosk for a cup of coffee. I then headed to the fiery that goes across Seven Seas Lagoon. The wait on the boat before we set sail across the lagoon was so long that I drank the entire cup of coffee before we left the dock...LOL But that meant that I didn't need to hassle with that cup once I arrived at Magic Kingdom...hehehe

I arrived at MK shortly after 8am. Technically, I missed *rope drop*...LOL But that's okay. It was still early enough to count as at least being there about the time it opened. After I took some quick videos, I made my way to get my first set of PhotoPass pictures for the day! I enjoy doing the photos. I don't always like looking at them. I mostly do those to share with others. But it is fun to have them taken. I feel famous...LOL jk And the *magic shots* are always fun. It gives me the chance to feel *animated*...hehehe

Next, I made my way to a quick service to get some breakfast. Yeah, I'll not be doing that breakfast again. I went to *The Friar's Nook*. I had a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel with *potato barrels* (tater tots). Those were mid at best. I did enjoy the eggnog shake, though. I went there for the shake mostly. But I also had never been there before. So, I thought I'd try something new. A one and done experience for me...LOL

I wasn't sure what attraction(s) I was going to do at MK. I started to walk around and came across Space Mountain. I realized it had been a while since I've ridden it. The wait time was 50 minutes. I didn't really have any set plans in the morning. So I decided I'd do it. I soon realized they do a special holiday edition...hehehe So I quickly became happy with the choice. I hadn't ever ridden that version.

The wait was much shorter than 50 minutes. Plus I told them I was a single rider and they sent me down a special path. I skipped about 15 minutes worth of people after having only been in line for about 20 minutes...LOL I really enjoyed the special holiday edition. It's basically Christmas lights and music. In the ride photo, I look like I'm a time travel visiting from the 1920s among modern day *astronauts*...LOL

After that, I did Carousel of Progress. And I tried to do some shopping. They didn't have what I was looking for, though. Before I left MK, I decided to see if the barbour shop had availability for my first haircut in about 5 years. They did and I got a trim...hehehe That was a fun experience. My last haircut was at the same place just before the pandemic shut the world down. Technically, I had another haircut after that...but it was to remove my hair so that I could shave my head...LOL And that was at home due to the pandemic...LOL

Shortly after I put my name in for the haircut, someone else came to put their name in. I was told I'd be waiting about 10 minutes. He were told it would be 20 for him...LOL I wasn't in any hurry. So, I went to the Cast and asked them to switch our names so *Rick* could go before me...hehehe

As I continued to wait, someone came up to me to ask where the Starbucks was. I went ahead and directed them to it since I knew where it was. They thought I was Cast with my dapper attire...LOL I enjoyed being able to help them, though.

I was called for my haircut and got *Cari*. She did a great job and was a lot of fun to talk to. We did a video selfie after I was done. They don't allow tipping on credit cards at the barbour shop and I didn't have any cash. So the Cast that took my payment told me where the ATM was. I walked over to the ATM to get some cash and then returned to the barbour shop to give Cari her tip...hehehe

That was the end of my time at MK. So I made my way over to EPCOT for my lunch reservation. I reserved the Nine Dragons restaurant in the China pavilion and went with the Candlelight Processional package. I chose the China pavilion for the meal as a nod to *A Christmas Story*. I went with the duck fried rice. Once again, a nod to the film. Oddly, though, I didn't watch that one this year...LOL The meal was delicious. With the package, I was given a seat at the 6:45pm performance of the Candlelight Processional.

Before lunch, I got some PhotoPass pictures of my outfit with Spaceship Earth in the background. But just before that, a family stopped me to ask me if I worked there as they needed some assistance finding where to go. I told them I wasn't Cast but I would be happy to help them if I could. They wanted to go to the Nemo and Friends attraction. I knew exactly where they needed to go...hehehe So I gave them detail directions for finding it. If memory serves, I believe there were 5 people in the family. Each of them thanked me for helping and wished me a Merry Christmas.

They had that look in their eye of gratitude because a stranger, who didn't even work there, took the time to help them out. I think that is what I love most about dressing up at the parks. People ask for help and I absolutely love helping when I can. And I can direct them to the nearest Cast member if I'm unable to help. I don't do this for the attention. So, it is a blessing to be able to be helpful when it does get attention.

After lunch, I made my way over to Disney's Animal Kingdom. The first thing I did there was get my PhotoPass pictures in front of the Tree of Life. While I was in line for that, someone called me out of line to ask if I would take their picture in front of the tree...hehehe Using their phone, I took several from different angles. Half as portrait and half as landscape. After they confirmed they were happy with the photos, I got back in line for my PhotoPass...LOL

They didn't ask if I worked there. But I presume they thought I did. I do get asked to help take pictures even when I'm not dressed up. And sometimes I offer when I see a group who looks like they need help with a group photo. But I was standing in line for something when this couple asked for help. I wasn't just randomly standing nearby...LOL I think I can surmise they thought I was Cast...LOL

After my photos, the bird show in front of the tree was just beginning. So I watched that again. I love that show! I then proceeded to walk towards Expedition Everest. I went by way of Dino Land and the Nemo show. As I was walking by the Nemo show, I asked when the next performance was. They said it was just starting right then...hehehe So I made my way into the auditorium to watch the show. It was great timing...LOL As I was making my way into the auditorium, I did a little leap and trot in a playful, dapper style dance...LOL One of the Cast laughed and say something like, *I don't think they'll invite you to the stage*...HAHAHA

After Nemo, I went to ride Expedition Everest using the single rider line. That was fun. Once again, the ride photo looked like I was a time traveler visiting from the 1920s among a group of modern day *explorers*...LOL

Next, I went to Yak and Yeti for a quick snack. While I was sitting there, a gentlemen from the Bahama's sat next to me. We chatted for a bit. He likes to travel and vacation all around the world. I didn't ask him what he does for a living. But I imagine it is something that pays well enough to afford him to travel as often as he mentioned...hehehe Perhaps he runs a tourist business in the Bahamas...LOL That's their entire economy...HAHAHA

By the end of that chat, it was time for me to head back over to EPCOT. I wanted to ride Living with the Land before my Candlelight Processional time. They have Living with the Land all decked out for the holiday. I love the attraction in general. But Christmas time is always much better. They have it all lit up with Christmas lights.

Because of that ride's popularity at Christmas, the line was a tad long and the ride got backed up a bit at the end of the attraction. After I got off, I had to walk very fast over to the American pavilion to get in the line for my spot where the Candlelight Processional was...hehehe But I made it in time just before they started to seat people. When I got into the seating area, I noticed a lot of empty space on the front row. So I headed on down there to get a seat.

As I got to talking with the lady next to me on the front row, we got to talking about the importance of a daily relationship with God. That it is a lifestyle and not just something we do on Sunday or Wednesday (as some churches have a Wednesday service too). We got on the subject because she asked me if I played an instrument...LOL I told her I used to. And the conversation ended up on how my brother is now playing his electric bass in the worship band from time to time. The conversation was such a blessing.

The Candlelight Processional was amazing! Edward James Olmos was the narrator. The live choir and orchestra were amazing. It is basically a presentation of the *greatest story ever told* with scripture being read and music to accompany the story. Seeing that at Disney is pretty special. Between the parks in California and here in Florida, I believe they've been doing this for over 60 years now. As I was leaving, several people wished me a Merry Christmas and they noticed my outfit...hehehe

The entire presentation was about 55 minutes long. So, I didn't end up having time to go over to Hollywood Studios to do all that I wanted to over there. I technically could have gone over just to say I hit all 4 parks. But I wouldn't have had time to really do anything. I would have wanted to see a show, do a ride, and have something to eat in order to declare that I actually visited the park...hehehe So, I stayed a little longer than planned at EPCOT and ate a few things from the festival there.

On my way out of EPCOT, I did one last PhotoPass experience to have my pictures in front of a Christmas tree at night. I love how those turned out. I then made my way back to the TTC and headed home.

In total, I was away from home about 18 hours after only having about 5 hours sleep. That's why I'm so surprised I'm functioning today...LOL

It was a blessed day. It was my first time being away from home (Indiana) on Christmas. But I was at home (Disney) on Christmas...HAHAHA

I sort of said this earlier...but I think my favorite thing was helping people. It was a little thing...but perhaps it meant a lot to them in the moment. I'm so glad God provided the path for me to be there yesterday. I don't really know if I'll ever do Christmas at Disney again. But I'm grateful I did it this year <3

It was fun sharing my day. I didn't feel alone. Plus, capturing things to send and showing the day through my eyes and ears (the videos), means I have something to go back to over and over again to relive the moments <3
