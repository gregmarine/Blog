The past few days have been interesting and fun! Saturday, I traveled most of the day to California. Before I left Florida, I had lunch at Zen and had the opportunity to check out a car show in New Port Richey. My first flight was delayed a bit. But that didn't impact my second flight. I had a few moments when I thought it might. But I kept praying about it. I spent the first flight praying most of the 4 hours and 15 minutes we were in the air. I've never done that before. I typically have something to read or watch for such a long flight. I'm glad I chose to pray instead. I have a lot to pray about...hehehe The second flight was a little different. It was much shorter and the person next to me was great to talk with. I saw an opportunity to share Jesus with him. It turned out he is a Christian as well. So, although I didn't introduce him to Jesus, it was great to talk about Jesus...hehehe

I arrived safely in California on time. Although it was a long day, I stayed up as late as I could to be sure I would sleep in the next morning. That next day was my first Disney day for the trip. I didn't want to wake up too early because I had planned to stay at Disney for as long as I could. This is the first time I've been to Disneyland Resort. I wanted to take in as much as I could. I don't mean riding all of the attractions. I mean taking in the vibe, seeing the property, and do as many attractions as I felt I wanted to without waiting in long lines.

I didn't take a lot of pictures. I wanted to live in the moment. I did take a few, though. I have a few videos as well. I'm so glad I lived in the moment, though. I shared this special day with Cherie throughout my time there. It was fun thinking about how she has been to most of the places I went through. I even had the same potstickers she has had...hehehe I also recreated a photo she had taken back in May. We may try to recreate it again on Friday with the two of us...hehehe

I arrived to Disneyland for rope drop. There were a lot of people who did the same. Once those ropes dropped, everyone went to their favorite attractions. I just stood there and watched everyone start their magical day...hehehe
