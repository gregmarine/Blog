# Happiest Day on Earth

Happy Veterans Day!!! I appreciate all who served <3

After my day on Friday, I thought to myself, *this was my favorite day*. I was mostly thinking about it for the year in that moment. After the amazing weekend I had, I now realize Friday was the best day of my life. Since it relates to my Disneyland day with Cherie, I can call it my *Happiest Day on Earth* because it happened at the *Happiest Place on Earth*...hehehe

The entire weekend was full of time with Cherie, actually. We spent the day together on Friday. But we also did our weekly video call with our Bible study fellowship and regular friendship experience on Saturday. And then on Sunday, I *brought* her along on my travel journey in spirit. After I got home, we chatted over text until I went to bed. This was the best, and my favorite, weekend for my entire life. And that's saying a lot! Although I sometimes talk about some of the bad circumstances I've faced, I've actually had some really amazing things happen in my life. To say this past weekend was the most amazing weekend I have ever had means so much <3

For me, the day started off pretty much as it did the Sunday before for my first ever visit to Disneyland. The main differences were that I started in Disney's California Adventure and that I knew I'd be meeting up with Cherie later. Other than that, I was still dressing up dapper for a day at the Disney parks in California...hehehe I arrived via Lyft and started my day!

DCA's opening was more memorable than DL's. I don't even remember anything special about rope drop at DL...LOL But at DCA, they did an amazing presentation over the speakers that talked about Walt Disney coming to California in 1923 to begin his adventure. That felt quite special.

As I was waiting for the day to begin, I was able to get a few PhotoPass opportunities in. I'll likely be posting some of those PhotoPass photos on my socials in a week or two. I'm never in a rush to post these days...hehehe I like how they turned out. I think it is fun to get those photos. Especially when I'm all dressed up...LOL

Once the park officially opened, I made my way over to the Monster's Inc. ride. It is basically the story of the first movie. I really liked it. It is more geared to the little ones. But that's one of the things I love about Disney rides...hehehe They are mostly calm and immersive. They don't have to include Disney IP to feel fun. But I'm also okay that they seem to be converting everything into IP themes.

After Monster's Inc, I rode Mickey's Death Wheel, the swings, the zephyr, Incredicoaster, and Toy Story Midway Mania. While going on those rides, I was getting updates from Cherie on her travel from home to Disneyland. I'm not going to go into it, as it's her story to tell. But let's just say it was probably the worst traveling experience she has had! I cannot possibly imagine what she was feeling as she went through it all. But I'm glad God provided for her and got her to Disneyland Resort safely.

Once we were together to officially start our Disney Day, we prayed. That felt like a very special moment. We do pray together often. But it is always more special when we get to do it in person. Although we could have started at either park, we decided to start with DCA. One of the first things we did was recreate a special photo she had made from her trip back in May. That was so much fun!

As far as rides go, we did Toy Story Midway Mania and Radiator Springs Racers. This was the first time she had ridden either of those two. So that was special too! I love to go on rides with people for their first time...hehehe We got the ride PhotoPass photo from the Racers ride and had a good laugh...LOL

When it was time to grab a small snack, we ventured over to DL to go to Jolly Holiday Bakery Cafe. Neither of us had been there. So, yet another special moment for both of us. I'm so glad we were able to share in these special moments...hehehe
