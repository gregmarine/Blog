## Not a Test

I'm learning quite a bit this year...hehehe I'm really excited about all this life is teaching me. For a while, I thought I was a failure at so many things. I'd mentally beat myself up over every little thing I messed up in my life. That negative self-talk created a landfill style landscape in my mind that made it difficult to feel any sort of love for the good parts about who I am. I received a text this morning that sounded like something I use to tell myself when I was struggling with the darkest moments of my life. I'll dissect it here in a bit. But it prompted me to think about how my thought life as changed these last 3-4 years; especially the improvements occurring this year. I'll likely turn this into Vitamin G someday...hehehe

I use to feel like a failure. But life isn't a test. It's a lesson. I'm still learning. I'm still growing. I'm accountable for my own actions. I'm not accountable for anyone else. I fall down. I get back up. I don't keep trying. I keep doing. I apply the lessons I'm learning and I keep moving forward. It isn't about passing or failing. Things in life just are. I'm to make the most of what I can do today. The past is gone and the future isn't here yet. All I have is now. This isn't a test. It's just homework that is preparing me for what's next.
