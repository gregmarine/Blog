## SUNDAY!!!

I absolutely love Sunday! And it isn't just because of church. Honestly, there are Sundays I don't want to go to church. And as I've matured in my faith, I actually won't go on those days I'm just not feeling it. I do that prevent myself from resenting my faith, if that makes sense?

The reason I love Sunday so much is that it is another day. I absolutely love every day! Sure, there are days when I don't really want to love anything...hehehe Not everything is awesome. My positive attitude takes a day off quite often, actually. But the fact that I am still here means that God isn't through with me just yet. He has a plan. And that is well worth celebrating!

So, as long as He has given me another day, I will rejoice and be glad in it. For this is a day that He has made! I'm asking Him to guide everything I think, say, and do today. I pray that it all brings Glory to Him. After all, He is the point of everything, right!?

I'm feeling the church vibe today. I'm grateful to be going to church today. Since I don't always feel that way, I do get extra excited on the Sundays I do feel it. But I must remind myself that these are just feelings. And, as a human, feelings can *lie* to me. That's why I remain in the Word every single day...regardless how I *feel*.
