## Daylight Savings and the Dark Years

I did not grow up with this thing called *Daylight Savings Time*. And as such, when I first experienced it, I did not like it...HAHAHA I first dealt with it in my years living in Illinois; 2005-2009. Indiana, however, did not observe *DST* from 1970 through 2006.

When I returned to Indiana in 2009, I was already exposed to the concept and had no issue transitioning since Indiana was back to observing it too while I was away those 4 years. *Those 4 years...* Although not directly tied to *DST*, my time in Illinois is what I *affectionately* refer to as my *Dark Years*. I'm using the word *affectionately* sarcastically in this context...hehehe

If ever I write a memoir, I'll discuss in detail what those years were truly like. Someone out there has experienced or is experiencing a similar season of their life. Perhaps talking about my own experience will in someway help or encourage them. At the time, I felt very much alone. However, I have since learned that so many others experience such times.

My suicide attempt was in October 2005 and led to 4 years of misguided pharmaceutical and in-patient treatments that have taken an additional 15 years to recover from. Of course, the obvious thing is that I failed at that attempt to take my own life. Perhaps equally as obvious, and the key thing, is that I have truly recovered from it.

Although it has taken 15 years, God has used these years to teach me so many wonderful things. To go through those *Dark Years* and still be praising God today is somewhat a miracle. At least it is to me. I use to resent what happened. I use to resent the people involved. *DST* use to be a trigger to remind me of what happened. I don't feel that way any longer. Now, I pray for those who played a role and I look at *DST* as a reminder that my favorite time of year has arrived.

Just as each year goes through it, our lives go through seasons. Spring is almost here this year. And my own life is about to go through a *Spring* of sorts. I'm growing just as the leaves on the trees are budding. March winds bring April showers. April showers bring May flowers. The *Secret Garden* of my heart is just about to burst with color and life! And tonight's time change is a welcome reminder of this wonderful season...both for the year, and for my life!

Welcome back *Daylight Savings*! I've missed you old friend!
