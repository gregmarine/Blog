# Warm Hug

I'm Greg and I like warm hugs <3

Today was a special Disney day...hehehe I went to the last day for this year's Food and Wine Festival at EPCOT. And I did so in my Olaf Disney bound...hehehe Although I have worn that twice since I debuted at EPCOT last year for Thanksgiving, this was my first time doing so again at Disney. And boy am I glad I did it again today...LOL

The day started off like most days with the exception of going to bed a little early last night and waking a little early. I wanted to snag a virtual queue group for Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind. Since that happens before my usual wake up time as of late, I wanted to be sure to get up earlier...hehehe

But before that, I did my morning prayer and read today's Bible in a Year session. First things first, God! I don't always do the Bible reading that early, but I have been lately. The prayer, though, is always first. That has been the case since early October last year...hehehe After my time with God, I managed to shave before the virtual queue time came. So after I got the group, I got dressed and headed out the door.
