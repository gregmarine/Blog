## 7:55am

I've been a little off as of late. Based on past experience, I feel it might be the onset of depression. I've had several work days were I felt like I needed to take a mental health day but didn't. I've been sort of *white knuckling* through each day telling myself it will pass.

I woke up with so much anxiety today that I finally pulled the plug and took the day off. I have plenty of time off. If I save it, I will get a payout once the transition to the new company happens. However, there is still value in taking some time off between now and then. On a day like today, I felt I really needed it. So there is more value in my taking the day off than in saving the time for a payout later.

Although I'm at a slower pace, I'm going about my morning otherwise the same as I would normally. I started with my daily morning prayer wake up time and daily Bible app refresh. Regardless how I feel, I've been consistent with that for the past 138 days now. It helps shape my attitude for the day. So I do not see myself ever missing that part. Consistency is a great thing. Especially for how my mind seems to work.

After that, I didn't actually do my next consistent thing, however. Instead of doing one of my devotionals, I decided to check my texts and emails. I never do that so early in the day. It's typically 2-3 hours after I wake before I get around to doing that. But part of the reason I did that today was because I needed to send a text to my boss letting him know that I was taking the day off.

After slowly meandering through those messages, I eventually got up to shave and shower. One thing I have taken away from all the counseling I've been through is that when I'm depressed, I really need to take care of myself. I wasn't filthy and my face and head didn't really look like they needed shaving. But doing those tasks when I'm feeling the way I do are actually quite therapeutic and therefore necessary.

I then made my coffee and poured my orange juice. And now I'm starting today's journal entry. I chose to write before doing any of my devotionals because I just needed to get some of this out. Writing has helped me immensely this year. I'd like to remain fairly consistent with writing. I may even start keeping my iPad with me where ever I roam. I'd like to start bringing it with me to Disney as well. Perhaps I'll end up at Disney today...hehehe If I do go, I'll be sure to bring my iPad with me so I can continue to write throughout the day.
