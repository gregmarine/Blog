# TBD

It has been a few days since I last journaled. That doesn't really mean anything beyond it being a relatively full week. Funny thing is, I don't have a whole lot to talk about tonight. I'm mostly writing just to remain in the habit of it.

Last year, I learned small, sustainable changes lead to new habits. From time to time, those habits need a break. So long as I get back to them on a consistent basis, they'll remain habits. If a habit falls to the wayside, well, that's okay too. But writing will not be one of those...hehehe

Writing has been a soul soother this year. It satisfies a hunger to express. It is far easier than painting or most other forms of artistic expression. Those other things have their place and will continue to be a part of who I am. But writing flows like a stream in the desert.

I'm having a good week. I almost wrote *really good* week. I decided to drop the *really* simply because there have been and will be better weeks. But to declare this week *good* still means so much. It means I'm happy. And anyone who truly knows me, me being happy is a really good thing. Not because I make other people miserable when I'm not happy...hehehe In fact, I tend to make others happy even when I'm not. But rather, because happiness has eluded me for so many years.
