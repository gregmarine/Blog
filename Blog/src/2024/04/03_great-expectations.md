# Great Expectations

Today, I'd like to talk about expectations and how they relate to how I respond to my world. As I mentioned yesterday, I've been experiencing some sadness this week. And I also mentioned how I find it difficult to trust people with my feelings. When I strip away the circumstances (people, places, and things), I'm left with only my expectations.

I'm not going to go in depth into any specific circumstance here. I don't feel it is necessary to do so. But perhaps I'll use some high level examples along the way that draw from my own experiences?

I have found that I set a certain level of expectation in my own mind about certain things. Take a movie or TV show for example. I'll watch the previews and get in my mind of how well I'll like the show. I think previews are design for that very purpose. They are to entice me to go watch whatever it is. If I set my expectations too high and the show does not quite meet what I think it should be for me, then I'm left with disappointment. If I set my expectations too low and the show is fantastic, then I'm left not only feeling fulfilled in my decision to see the show, I might actually think it is far better than it really is.
