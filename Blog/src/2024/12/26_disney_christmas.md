# Disney Christmas

Today is a doubleheader journal entry day...hehehe The other entry is a timestamp entry for my day. This one will be about my Disney Christmas yesterday. I failed to journal about Disney Thanksgiving. Which is perfectly fine. It wasn't my first time doing Disney for Thanksgiving. But this is my first Christmas at Disney. It is so special.

I went to bed *early* on Christmas Eve expecting that I'd want to get up early Christmas morning and *rope drop* Magic Kingdom. Early is relative. So, going to bed early just meant I wasn't going to stay up past midnight as I usually do. I think I was in bed by 10:30pm that night...hehehe So not that early for this timezone...LOL I think I was awake around 4am Christmas morning.

Being up that early was nice in that I didn't need to rush to get ready. I was able to do my morning routine, minus breakfast and coffee. I waited for those latter items for Disney...hehehe But I was able to do everything else at a nice pace. I was ready to walk out the door about 45 minutes before I needed to leave...hehehe

There wasn't any traffic to speak of on my way to Disney. That was to be expected. First of all, it was super early. Secondly, it was Christmas. There wouldn't have been the typical commuter traffic for those working in the Orlando area. I think it took about an hour and 45 minutes to get there using the back roads. I prefer the back roads for a few reasons. The back country of Florida is beautiful and it saves on fuel...hehehe

Arriving at Disney's Ticket and Transportation Center (TTC) so early meant I was able to get a great parking spot. It wasn't too far from security. I don't mind parking far now that I'm healthier. But I knew my day would be long and I'm glad I didn't have far to walk after such a long day...hehehe
