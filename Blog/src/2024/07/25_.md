I'm going to try my best to put into words how I feel about happiness. I'm not sure my words will adequately describe what I want to say. That's okay. This year has taught be a great deal about love and happiness. Since these are recent thoughts, perhaps sometime in the future I'll find a better way to describe this feeling. In the meantime, I'll give it my best shot...hehehe

I recently discovered how I can best choose happiness most days. I've long believed that happiness and contentment are choices. I can have everything I could possible ever want and still be unhappy. I can have absolutely nothing at all and yet remain in a happy frame of mind. So my contentment and happiness really have nothing to do with my circumstances. It all comes down to the condition of my heart.

My thoughts take me way past an attitude of gratitude here. And it goes deeper than simply making the choice to be happy. The *happiness is a choice* saying is just that...a saying. And an *attitude of gratitude* is just a fun way to rhyme about the choices I make to be happy. What actions can I take to put in the effort needed to be happy and content? How do I choose to be happy every day?
