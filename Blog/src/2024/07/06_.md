# TBD

Today is an important day. Today is the day I get to spend a moment with my deer friend in person for the first time. We've known each other for a few years now having met on Twitter during the pandemic. Our mutual interest in Disney brought us together. She had shared a thought on Twitter that gained a lot of attention in the DisTwitter community. It caught my attention, and we became mutuals on that platform. We have since followed each other on various other social media platforms. But that is where it began.

She later commented on one of my posts about my paintings. That later inspired *Bambi's Bird*; which now adorns her book crate along with a second painting, *Bambi's Yawn, Thumper's Curiosity*. With the first painting, I included a note of encouragement along with my personal phone number to use anytime she needed to talk. A few months later, she reached out to me via text to encourage me. A true friendship has grown and blossomed ever since.
