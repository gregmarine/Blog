Peace does not necessarily mean the absence of conflict. Often times, peace is about finding a resolution to the conflict. In my life, I want to face conflict by finding unity through the bond of peace. Making peace with others is greater than keeping the peace.

Psalms 34:14 reads,

> Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it.

This short passage inspired me this morning to contemplate being a peace seeker, or peacemaker. Keeping peace can sometimes lead to sacrificing too much of myself in the pursuit of peace. However, making peace seems to lend more to the process of finding peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in my life. I've spent most of my life being a peacekeeper. I would either keep my mouth shut when something bothered me, or I would just pretend everything was okay for the sake of remaining at peace with those around me. What ultimately happens, in every situation where I have done this, is my spirit erodes underneath the surface or the relationship I have with the other person begins to evolve into more conflict. Simply "keeping the peace" would inevitably lead to far worse circumstances.

A quick search of the Bible led me to a few passages I'm going to meditate on as I begin to understand what God is teaching me this morning:

* Proverbs 15:1
> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

* Matthew 5:9
> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.

* Romans 12:18
> If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with everyone.

* James 3:17-18
> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

* Ephesians 4:1-3
> I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love, being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

* John 16:33
> I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.
