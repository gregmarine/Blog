## Welcome



## Behind the Curtain

For my entire life, I can be classified as a Christian. I was raised in the church. With the exception of a 6 year period, I've gone to church most of my life. Along the way I have strayed from the *path* a few times and have even looked into various other religions. But I've always been pointed back to following Jesus, the Christ. That said, I'd like to make one thing absolutely clear. I am not a religious person. For me, it is all about the relationship. Religion has had a negative connotation in my life; whereas relationship draws out the positive. The former carries with it the burden of obligation. It signifies requirement over choice. The latter bears the burden for me through the sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. His sanctifying Grace draws me into a desire to know Him and a longing to Love as He does. I truly feel the condition of my heart far outweighs anything I am able to do. It sets the tone for the *why* I do anything.

*So, I was praying...* is a look *behind the curtain of a work in progress*. My progress. The reflections written on these pages are mine, and mine alone. Also included on these pages are a public domain Bible and a set of resources I've put together to help anyone who so desires to have a relationship with Jesus as well. Unless otherwise noted, the resources have come from my personal relationship with Jesus. As they guide me on my *path* He has set before me, I too hope they can be a guide for you on your *path*. The reflection section is the exception. In that section, I include my personal reflection notes from devotionals I have engage in from other resources I've come across on this journey. Where I am able, I include links to those devotionals so you too can engage with them if you so choose.
