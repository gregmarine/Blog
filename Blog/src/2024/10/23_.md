I slept a little better last night. Not quite as well as I would have liked. But so much better than the night before. Perhaps my body is fighting something off from the weekend that I'm unaware of? I don't feel *sick*, though. So, I have no idea...hehehe

I'm just about to begin work for today. But I wanted to get this journal entry kicked off before I did.

I had some weird dreams. But no nightmares this time. So, that's good. And my beard and hair are coming in nicely still. I see a little more progress each morning. Of course, I'm only on day three...LOL

What's in store today? *Father God, what are we doing to do today?*

Through a series of very specific events of my morning, I came upon Autumn on a walk during a work break. I was able to minister to her with something she is going through right now. It isn't one of those *God told me to tell you* sort of things. I simply acknowledge that God provided the path for me to be able to minister to her in that exact moment.

For the most part, I simply listened and reassured her of what she felt God has been telling her through her personal prayer and Bible study time. It all aligns with scripture to the best of my own knowledge. I then presented her with a few rhetorical questions I've been asking myself this year along my own faith journey.

This was all unplanned by us humans. Everything about my own personal morning led to this opportunity. I don't know how her morning led her to the Bark Park at the very moment I walked by. But, it seems as those these things have been happening in my life a lot lately. I keep feeling these moments of *wait* or *go here* and then things just align. I'm not searching for these things. They simply happen. I'm grateful for these opportunities to experience God in this way.

*Father God, what are we going to do next?*
