# Don't Worry

Today's lesson from *The Chosen* devotional (book 4, day 25) hits home for me. This isn't the first time these devotionals have talked about worry. But each time, they provide a different perspective. My handwritten journal for today was brief. As I reflected on the devotional, I decided I would keep those notes brief this time. I think I may have too much to say about it than what I could physically write on paper...LOL I hope to document more of my thoughts here in my online journal today. It's far easier for me to type than to handwrite...hehehe

I've spent a good deal of my life worrying. One of my weaknesses has been imagining worst-case scenarios or dwelling on all the what-ifs that could happen. I play these scenarios out in my mind over and over. I start to see alternate scenarios spin off from those and it can go on and on. I've spiralled out of control a few times and had panic attacks. I spent years in and out of the hospital. And I've been on countless medications.

There are those in my life who do not suffer anxiety. They don't even worry, really. And they say things like *don't worry*, as if I can simply turn it off...LOL That can feel dismissive. I feel invalidated when I'm not shown compassion. I think that may be why I am so sensitive to others' anxieties, worries, doubts, concerns, and fears. I can listen to that all day long and I'll pray for them. I'll sometimes offer up some advice that has helped me. That can be tough sometimes, though. Sometimes, they just need someone to listen.

I no longer suffer these things now and I'm no longer being treated for any of it through professional help or medications. I still have worry, doubts, anxieties, concerns, and fear. They just no longer control me. They typically lead me to prayer now. But I stress that the *suffering* is gone. And those worst-case scenarios and what-ifs that play in my head no longer lead to running thoughts.

What changed in my life to allow me to overcome worry? The obvious answer is Jesus. However, how He did it isn't so obvious. And it isn't so easy to explain. I'm not going to be able to do it justice, really. I'll do my best to write some of my thoughts in hopes that it may help others. And I hope when I reread this someday, it will be good reminder. Also, there are several journal entries that are related to this. I often think and write about the various things God has taught be along my journey. *So, I was thinking...* is basically my telling of the story of the God who saved me...hehehe
