# TBD

The trash valet did not pick up my trash last night...hehehe Pickup nights are Sunday through Thursday. Sometimes they miss due to weather. Last night, there were no weather events...LOL When I saw the trash bag in my bin this morning, I grabbed it and walked it across the entire complex over to where the trash compactor is. As I was on my way, it was tempting to be a little upset. After all, I am required to pay for this service that I did not receive. Also, the valet company is always complaining about the tenants and we get emails weekly about it. I quickly dismissed my personal feelings, though. I realize that my life could come to an end today. Did it really matter that my trash wasn't picked up last night? Not one bit! Also, it was a great reminder of how God has healed my body. At the beginning of 2023, I wasn't physically capable of carrying a bag of trash that far. It's true! It was a simple reminder of how God has healed. But it still makes a huge impact on my heart.

Today's *The Chosen* devotional helped put this into perspective. I'm grateful I did today's lesson before encountering the lack of service from the trash valet...hehehe The parable mentioned today was the one with the farmer who had an abundant crop. He stored it all up and declared he would eat, drink, and be merry on the *wealth* he had amassed. Then God called him a fool and told him his life would be demanded of him that very night. So, who was going to inherit this abundant crop after all?!?

I feel as though this lesson applies to more than just possessions. I can apply this same lesson to all circumstances. Including the trivial trash fail from last night...LOL You see, letting go of the simple means my heart remains soft. Those simple things can add up over time. If I allow my heart to be hardened by the simple issues of life, I'll amass an abundance of resentment that will eventually cause me to become angry over the bigger picture stuff. But what good would that be if my life was demanded of me today and my heart wasn't prepared for His Kingdom?

Of course, the parable itself was about being rich in God instead of *earthly possessions*. That doesn't escape me. That was indeed the context of the passage. However, for someone who has literally had to restart his life several times, I must look for other ways to apply such a lesson. Life itself taught me that my possessions are meaningless in the big picture. I've lost everything multiple times. But I also feel that all of the lessons of the Bible can be applied to almost any circumstance anyway. That's one of the many fascinating aspects of the Bible being the living Word of God. I believe it literally applies to everything in my life. Today's lesson reminded me to store up goodness in my heart. That goodness is one of the many things that will make me rich in God.
