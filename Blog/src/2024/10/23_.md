I slept a little better last night. Not quite as well as I would have liked. But so much better than the night before. Perhaps my body is fighting something off from the weekend that I'm aware of? I don't feel *sick*, though. So, I have no idea...hehehe

I'm just about to begin work for today. But I wanted to get this journal entry kicked off before I did.

I had some weird dreams. But no nightmares this time. So, that's good. And my beard and hair are coming in nicely still. I see a little more progress each morning. Of course, I'm only on day three...LOL

What's in store today? *Father God, what are we doing to do today?*
