# TBD

I'm a bit tired today...hehehe I did not sleep well last night. I kept dreaming about California. I woke up in the middle of the night around 3:14am; which would have been around 12:14am in California. I'm not really on California time right now, though. I got up to go to bathroom...LOL As for the poor sleep. Well, I think that was due to the anxiety of yesterday. So it's explainable...hehehe

I almost fell asleep during a meeting...oops! But speaking of work, it has been a low key kind of week. The transition to the new company has been going smoothly. Not stressful whatsoever. There are a few more events left with that for this month. There are also some out in the future later this year and into next year. It's a slow process. But I think that makes things a little better. For me at least...hehehe

I have a few new responsibilities now. Nothing too big yet. They aren't full on projects. I'm hoping to get some big projects soon. I am one who tends to thrive on the big stuff. I get excited and dive right on in. When I'm doing simple tasks, I often feel like I'm not doing enough for the company. But I'm reminded that I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing...hehehe

I haven't gone back to social media yet. I do get on there to check in on what a few folks are posting. But I don't scroll for long. When I was on my trip, I didn't feel like posting anything. I was living in the moment. But now that I'm back to my routine, I haven't gotten up to speed with that part yet. Honestly, I don't miss it much...hehehe I suppose if I get bored, I'll get back into the habit of scrolling more...LOL In the meantime, I'll keep checking out the latest for the few I feel drawn to keep up with...hehehe
