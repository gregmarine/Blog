# Vacation?

## Journal Unplanned

I wasn't planning on journaling today. But today was worth a journal...hehehe

I've been anxious about this trip. But the trip is here. Although my day for tomorrow has been planned for quite some time now, it being a vacation is a more recent happenstance.

I'm staying at the Coronado Springs resort at Walt Disney World resort. I booked this reservation a little bit ago. The plan to be at WDW began months ago. As this time approached, anxiety has crept in. But it has been getting better. Between talking with Chérie about it, and a quick chat with my sister today, I'm finally happy that this trip is happening.

Once I arrived today, and decided to extend my trip. I only planned to stay a few days to deal with the meetup I'll be a part of tomorrow. But once arrived, I realized it really isn't about tomorrow's meet up. It's about living my best life while I'm living it. So I booked another night Thursday night into Friday. I'll need to switch hotels. But that's okay.

## Today

I worked today. It was mostly a normal day at work. Nothing special to write about there...hehehe But out of the blue, my sister texted to see if she could drop by.

I was so happy to hear from Tracy. I was equally happy that I was able to welcome her into my home today. I was working, but hadn't taken my lunch yet. So I happily invited her to drop by!

She brought us Panera to enjoy for lunch. We had a great time just hanging out and talking. I ended up talking to her about the same concerns I had when I talked to Chérie a few weeks ago. Basically about what happened on New Year's Eve. I'm glad I was able to talk to Tracy about it as well as when I talked to Chérie. They are the only two I've been able to talk to about it.

When I arrived at Disney World this evening, all of the excitement I have for this place flooded in. I'm so glad to be here this week!

## Sushi!!!

I had a wonderful dinner tonight. I didn't really plan to be there when the fireworks at EPCOT began, but that just so happened to be when it all worked out. Seeing the show from my table was a huge plus! And the dinner I had was absolutely perfect. I was one of the last ones there tonight. So I was also able to enjoy some time in the park after it closed. I took some photos and sent them to Chérie. It was nice to be able to share them with her.

## Vacation

This is one of the first *vacations* I've been able to take in years. All of the other trips I've had were specifically for other people. This one is all about being me. The meetup tomorrow has me a little worried. But other than that, this vacation is a *me* vacation. I'll be sharing it with Chérie because I'm excited to share it with her. I'm so happy to be here right now. Happy isn't even a strong enough word for it. This is going to be the best time of my life!
