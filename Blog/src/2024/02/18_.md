## Vitamin G

Today's Vitamin G has been a sort of theme for this past year. All of the progress I've made personally can pretty much be summed up in what God inspired me to say today. The scripture behind it mainly comes from John 5:2-8,

> Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?” The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.” Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”

With that scripture in heart, these were the words I told myself:

> Do I want to be healed? I’ve made every excuse not to answer that in the affirmative. No more excuses, Greg! Get up and walk! No, get up and RUN! You are free!

I've been doing these posts on social media for just over 3 years now. It was almost 4 years ago when I started to apply this. It is good to think about such things. It provides me encouragement to keep going. When the weight of the negativity starts to creep in, I need to remind myself, *...do I want to be healed?*
