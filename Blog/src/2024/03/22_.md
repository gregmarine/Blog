# TBD

This has been quite the week. So much to write about that I wonder if I actually will...hehehe Sometimes I want to write and don't simply because some of my experiences need to remain in a place of my heart that no one else will ever see and that I'll bring back to remembrance without being prompted by what I wrote *today*. Sometimes, when I experience the same joy or pain at a later time, moments like what I'm referring to will come back through relatable emotions. There is something so intimate about that, you know?

The first thing I want to talk about today is actually something I wrote a letter about and decided not to send. I wrote the letter to process my thoughts and feelings on the matter. Partly to prepare myself for discussing the situation with my parents. But also to get the thoughts from whom I wrote the letter to. I'm not going to mention any names today because today's journal entry is about my own thoughts and feelings completely. Although I shared some experiences this week, there are so many other experiences from the week that I experienced solely with God. I'm writing about them today because I really need to process it all.

That's what I do when I write. Writing has given me the opportunity to get out my thoughts and feelings in a medium that allows me to meditate over everything I feel and think. This has been such a transformable year in this regard. Never before have I ever written so much. Some of it can be used for other purposes. While some of it is just rambling.
