*This year was supposed to be great. It's only the second day and I'm a loser...* ~ Ross Geller

I'm on day two of no coffee...I'm not doing so well...LOL j/k I knew it would be hard. But listen, I've gone a few days without coffee before. Why is it so hard *this time*?!? LOL Actually, I think my body might be fighting something...hehehe I got 7 and half great hours of sleep last night. Yet, I've been dragging all day long...LOL I haven't felt this tired in years. But every time I have something to eat, I suddenly feel energetic and wide awake. I think this means it is more than just about not having coffee for a few days...LOL

I'm considering not doing the prayer and fasting that I planned to start next week. But I may still keep to my coffee fast for this month anyway. I don't need to go through the formal plan I have done for the last few years. I can still connect with God in new ways. He's always doing new things in my life. Why not embrace that and change it up this year?
