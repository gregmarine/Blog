Good morning and Happy Wednesday! And Happy Hurricane Day...LOL Well, not so happy about that. But I'm also grateful I'm safe. I'm more concerned about those down south in the path of the storm. That concern is leading me to prayer. That's the silver lining for me. God is good and His Will will be done. My heart and prayers go out to those who are about to lose everything...again :(

I've lost everything multiple times in my life. For me, that has helped me realize that nothing I have is truly mine and that it can all be gone at any moment. But that's just how I feel. I cannot imagine what others feel. We all manage loss in our own ways. One thing I'll never do is project my own feelings about *stuff* onto them. The things we collect in our lives have meaning to us personally. So, even though I no longer attach strong meaning to things myself, my heart breaks for those who lose anything that has meaning to them.

I've decided I'm going to do a timestamp entry today. I have things on my heart and mind. Sometimes doing a timestamp entry helps me get it all out throughout the day. Plus we can all see how the day progresses as I process my thoughts and feelings...hehehe I never go back and reword things or take things out when I do one of these. My typical entries could be edited throughout the day or in a single sitting if I only write at night. But this timestamp format is something I do differently...hehehe

The other day, I mentioned that this is an important week. I summed up why by mentioning the anniversaries of some important events that fall on this particular week. Although I did journal yesterday, I did not make mentioned of one of those events on it's actual anniversary. But it did come up in a conversation with Autumn yesterday. Yesterday was the official 19th anniversary of my suicide attempt and survival. I mentioned it to her because she has one of those semicolon tattoos for suicide prevention awareness. I hadn't noticed it before yesterday.

Now that it is officially announced on social media, I wanted to mention it here. My son's mother, and my first wife, is now engaged to her long time boyfriend. He proposed to her on Sunday. Not long ago, she mentioned they had been talking about marriage. My heart is truly happy for them both. Her and I haven't always gotten along well after our divorce. But beginning in 2019, healing began. These last five years have allowed us to grow as friends again. So, this news was such a blessing.
