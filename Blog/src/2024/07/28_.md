# TBD

I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and decided I wanted to sleep in as much as I could this morning...hehehe So I slept in...hehehe Yesterday I slept in a little too. But yesterday it was basically that I went back to sleep after my alarm. Today, I pushed me alarm out well past my normal time. I sensed my body needing some rest today. And then in another plot twist, I ended up taking a nap this afternoon...hehehe I had been noticing my brain going through some fatigue last week. So perhaps it needed that extra rest this weekend. I'm feeling fine otherwise...with the exception of the fact I gained about 5 lbs in the last week...LOL I'll keep a close eye on my body and see if it is telling me anything. I hope these aren't warning signs...hehehe I'm certain everything is okay.

I took my normal morning walk this morning. But it was a bit different in a good way. I was offered a dog biscuit...they were joking, of course. I then took a few photos. I then was told *good morning sweetie* by a neighbor I do not really know yet. I enjoyed being referred to as *sweetie* as a term of endearment. It has been a while since someone has done that for me. This same neighbor thanked me for my kindness last week when I interacted with her dog. By the way, the dog biscuit offer was from a different neighbor...hehehe I then snapped a photo of a yellow flower that later shriveled up in the afternoon sun. So I'm glad I snapped that warm hug before it was gone forever! Just before my walk was over, I enjoyed some birds flying overhead and enjoyed a moment watching the fountain. It was a blessed way to start the day.

My weekly church experience was a bit different today as well...again, in a good way. Beginning in March, I was attending theChapel physically and then virtually attending service at Calvary Chapel Golden Springs in Diamond Bar, California. At the end of June, I left theChapel but continued *going* to CCGS. In fact, I physically went to CCGS on my trip to California. When I returned home, I started to virtually attend New Day Christian Church out of Port Charlotte, Florida. While I was in California, I started to sense my time at CCGS was coming to an end. Or at the very least, it was time for a break. Having been attending two churches since March was taking a toll on me. So today, I decided I would only attend NDCC and did not tune in for CCGS. It seems right to try to focus on a single church service for the time being.

Similar to how my brain was telling me it needed some rest, my soul was telling me it too needs some rest. My daily time in prayer and scripture has been going great. But the Sunday worship and message from a pastor *experience* was starting to weight heavy on my heart. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm just thinking that splitting my church experiences between multiple places isn't ideal. It had its purpose in the season of life I was going through at the time. But that season is now over and the next has begun. I'm not entirely sure what this new season in this area will be like. And that's okay. I didn't know what that last season was going to be like either...hehehe As long as I continue to grow and be drawn to Jesus, I think I'll be just fine.

The other day, I started a journal entry that remains unfinished. As I was writing it, it started to seem like it might become a chapter of a book or something. I'll likely do that regardless. But I do wonder if I'll finish it as a journal entry or not...LOL As I was trying to wrap it up, I realized I needed to give it some time before I publish it. It's mostly about how I am finding happiness lately. It feels like a heartwarming chapter of my life. The concepts I explore in it are relatively new to me, though. So I wasn't sure if I've given it all enough thought to actually put out here on my blog. Having written so much that day but not publishing it reminds me, that when there are gaps in my journal writing, it may not always be that I've taken a break or that I didn't have anything to say. Sometimes it's that I have incomplete thoughts that aren't ready just yet.

I've been re-reading my journal from this year. I've already read all of January. It has been great going back to my thoughts from earlier this year to see how my *today* was shaped by my *yesterday*. Imagine what it would have been like had I journaled my whole life...hehehe I don't have all of it now, but I did use to journal years ago. I would love to be able to read those entries again. But I am grateful that I started journaling now. I actually started last year. But it wasn't online at the time. I still have those entries in a private archive. Perhaps I should copy them here in this journal...hmmm...hehehe
