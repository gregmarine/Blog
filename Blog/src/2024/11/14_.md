# TBD

I was thinking about what sort of role I'd like to have in my industry if I weren't a Lead Software Engineer. And that led me to reminisce about what I would say was my favorite job. What triggered the thought was the fact I'm not really doing what I love to do. I do enjoy it enough to keep doing it. But it is more of a *I'm doing it because it is my job* sort of thing. As I pondered what other roles are available in my field, the ones I'm most attracted to are dealing with people. For instance, Project Management.

Well, that took me back to that job I had more than twenty years ago. I had already started my career in tech after having various other jobs like teacher, bookstore clerk, and sandwich maker...hehehe But I didn't like working in tech. Don't get me wrong, I love technology and enjoyed it as a hobby. I had the nack for it and, at the time, it made sense to attempt a career at it. Doing it for a job took the enjoyment away...LOL

I worked for a very toxic person and split from him to start my own company. I worked for him for about a year and then worked for myself for about another year. Running my own company came with some challenges. I decided I needed to get a steady job working for a company again. And since I wasn't really enjoying tech for work, I decided I'd leave tech, pursue a new career, and possibly still do tech as a side gig for extra cash.

Back then, you still had to look for jobs by actually looking...LOL I think there may have been a few job websites by then. But nothing like it is today. I asked around and found that a new call center for Allstate Insurance had just opened in Indianapolis. They were in great need for people. I jumped on it as quickly as I found out about it. The interview process was easy. I do well in those. They had an aptitude test I needed to take. I passed that without issue. I was offered a job almost instantly and I began my new career being a call center representative...hehehe

The job training was extensive. Not only did I need to learn their systems, I also needed to learn how the insurance industry worked. This particular call center was new for the company in that it specialized in small vehicle accident claims. Small fender bender type claims. Anything with an injury was immediately transferred to another department. I think our department was called Auto Express. The express in the name implies that all claims going through our center would be quick to resolve. That was mostly true...hehehe

After four weeks of training, it was time to be *out on the floor* taking calls. Mind you, I had never worked in a call center before. I really had no idea what it would be like answering calls and helping people who were in distress. I went into without any expectations whatsoever. I was a bit nervous at the time. After those first few calls, I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be.
