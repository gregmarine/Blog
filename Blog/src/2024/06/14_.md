# TBD

Back in January, I wrote in this journal every day for 3 weeks during my prayer and fasting that I did with my church. It was basically the official kickoff for this new blog site. About a month ago, I wrote most days in the timestamp format. In between and recently, I've just journaled as I was inspired. I can safely say that I absolute love writing. Sometimes I like to write in a more formal fashion. Sometimes I like to simply jot my thoughts. No matter what style I use, or for what purpose, I really enjoy writing...hehehe

I may spend the weekend working on some of my projects. I won't likely get very far. But progress is progress, right?! hehehe I've decided not to make any goals. I'll just do whatever feels right and see what comes of it all. I don't want to lose any of the passion by turning it into work, you know? One of the tasks I'd really like to tackle and accomplish this weekend is finishing up the setup of a few of my other sites. They are all linked to my *bygregmarine* domain. But I like to separate the contexts into subdomains. Such as this blog being under *blog*.bygregmarine.com and my art being at [*art*.by.gregmarine.com](https://art.bygregmarine.com). Both of these sites look and feel the same. However, the content is set in the context of their respective purposes and have an appropriate menu to navigate said content. It is somewhat like how my brain works. I compartmentalize my life in almost every aspect.

I'm considering joining [*The Unsealed*](https://theunsealed.com) community. Ch√©rie introduced me to it through one of her poems being published in one of their books, [*Unseal Your Worth*](https://www.amazon.com/Unseal-Your-Worth-Stories-Empower-ebook/dp/B0CT4D7QWH). She has since been published again in [*Unseal Your Best Life*](https://www.amazon.com/Unseal-Your-Best-Life-Revealing-ebook/dp/B0D6NZF8QW). I own both books. The former I've already read. The latter I just received yesterday. So I'm just getting started with it. As it turns out, there are now 6 books from [*The Unsealed* community on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0CGSMGY56/allbooks).

I first considered joining back when she first introduced me to it. Back then, I decided I wasn't quite sure about doing so. One of my concerns at the time was whether or not I was ready to deal with my past. I envisioned the writing challenges drawing all of the trauma out of the darkness and into the light. That doesn't sound like a bad thing. But I wanted to be ready to handle whatever that would mean for me. I had gotten really good with coping with it all. But revisiting the pain didn't sound like a good idea at the time.

Today, my perspective is quite different. My heart has been transformed. I no longer want to simply cope with the past. I feel I am ready to allow God to shed any Light He wants to on it. These last 5 months have opened my heart and mind to true healing.
