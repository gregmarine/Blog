# TBD

Back in January, I wrote in this journal every day for 3 weeks during my prayer and fasting that I did with my church. It was basically the official kickoff for this new blog site. About a month ago, I wrote most days in the timestamp format. In between and recently, I've just journaled as I was inspired. I can safely say that I absolute enjoy writing. Sometimes I like to write in a more formal fashion. Sometimes I like to simply jot my thoughts. No matter what style I use, or for what purpose, I really enjoy writing...hehehe
