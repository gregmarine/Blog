# Workcation

Another journal entry when the title came before writing...LOL I'm on a workcation...hehehe It isn't quite a vacation. It isn't quite a staycation. And it definitely isn't a naycation. I'm working from Disney World while also enjoying the amenities of the vacation capital of the world...hehehe

The room's coffee maker makes horrible coffee. So I made a quick trip to the food court to get a decent cup of coffee. I found a window of opportunity between rain showers. The impact of the storm is upon us here. It hasn't been bad yet. I actually don't know that it will ever get too bad here in central Florida. At least out of the ordinary for this area in this season of the year. The hurricane remains out in the gulf. The eye of the storm will not be passing over Disney World.

My workload is actually pretty light right now. Other people on my team seem to have heavier workloads than I do. However, they aren't the sort of tasks that can be shared with the likes of me. So, I'll just stick to my tasks and do my best not to worry about how others are doing on my team.
