# TBD

Today was quite a bit different from yesterday...hehehe I didn't climb any mountains...LOL I attempted to go to Azusa Wilderness Park. However, when I got to the road it is on, the road was closed. I'm unlikely to attempt going again on this trip. I'm leaning toward the Arboretum for Sunday. But I'm unsure of even that. It is going to be hotter this weekend I think. Hotter than hot seems like an indoor kinda of day...LOL

Since Azusa Wilderness Park didn't work out, I set my sights on seeing how easy it was to get to Union Station. It was super easy to get to...hehehe I had concerns about driving into LA. I don't normally like to drive into major cities. Well, it wasn't too bad for me. Once I got to Union Station, I decided to drive by The Last Bookstore to get a feel for the area it is in. I didn't have any issues driving through that part of the city either. The city didn't seem very busy today. There weren't even a lot of people walking around.
