# Calm Before the Storm

I normally title my journal entries after I've written them. That is typically so that I can title them with the main highlights of what we're about to read together...hehehe Today's title came before I wrote the entry. It is aptly named because Hurricane Helene is lurking out in the Gulf of Mexico. That's right! The tropical storm I mentioned yesterday is definitely a hurricane. It's predicted strength keeps increasing too. As of this writing, it is only a category 1. However, they are starting to predict it may become a category 4 before it makes landfall. Considering the original prediction was only a category 2 level, I'm guessing it could potentially be a category 5 by the time it actually does make landfall.

As the title suggests, I'm sitting in the calm before the storm. I mentioned yesterday I was bugging out to Disney. I left home around 2pm and arrived here around 4:15pm. The weather permitted me to make a quick trip to EPCOT for the evening to have some festival food, enjoy a ride in Mexico on the Grand Fiesta Tour attraction, and take in one of the concerts from the *Eat to the Beat* concert series. This included one lap around the World Showcase...about a mile in length. Overall, it was quite the enjoyable evening <3

There have been a few moments when I felt bad for coming to Disney when so many people are staying put back home. But this is my life and that is theirs. I was given this opportunity as a gift and I shouldn't feel bad for it. I'm learning to live my life as I'm suppose to live it. If that includes the ability to escape a storm by going to Disney, that should be okay, right?! I could have gone to a different hotel. But why? There really isn't anything wrong with coming to Disney if I have to stay in a hotel anyway. No one is making me feel guilty for this. It was just something in the back of my mind this week.

My family is thrilled I left the gulf coast well before the impact of the storm begins. I don't always leave. But this storm is quite different from others I've experienced. I didn't hesitate to make my plans to leave. And I do feel Blessed to be able to afford Disney. Plus, Disney is one of the safest places to be in Florida. They are well equipped to weather hurricanes. Whether or not they planned that from the beginning, I do not know. But they are at least that way now...LOL

Something else that happened today was my phone call with Pastor Doug. It was the beginning of a conversation about how I'm feeling about church these days. Our conversation was enlightening. I'm not ready to go into the deep end of what we discussed today. I'm still praying about and processing it all...LOL I know this is only the start of this part of my journey. I'll likely setup another call soon to continue the conversation.

One thing I am ready to mention, though, is the idea of comfort. One of the benefits of virtually attending Sunday services from home is that it is comfortable. That can be nice and provides some rest from the tug-o-war I was experiencing in the physical church. I felt drawn away from God when I am suppose to be drawing nearer to Him...LOL Doug asked me if, in the nearly three months I've been away from the physical church, I had been growing in my faith and closer to God. I immediately responded with an *absolutely, yes!* That response was good news to him. He feels it is okay that I'm in this season right now and that it provides the comfort I need.

I didn't tell him that I didn't like the sound of comfort...LOL I don't grow in the comfortable times...LOL I'm okay being comfortable for a time. But at some point, I need to step back out of my comfort zone in order to keep growing. I'm glad I'm still growing now despite being in the zone of comfort for the moment...hehehe But one of his other questions was about whether or not I knew what I need to look for in myself to know when it is time for that next change. Like, do I know how to tell if my growth has stopped...or something like that. To that I responded with, *no, I do not know.*
