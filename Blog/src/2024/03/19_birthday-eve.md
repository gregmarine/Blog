# Birthday Eve

I figure I should probably write a little tonight because I may not write anything tomorrow...hehehe Tomorrow is my BIRTHDAY!!!

I'm sure I wrote about this before, but I use to never celebrate my birthday. I hated to annual reminder that I was getting older. Not because of the *old* part. More like how adulting is hard work...hehehe I also didn't want to grow to become my dad! I love him dearly. But there is so much I don't want to be that he is...sorry dad!

Truth is, I'm not much like my dad. I'm more like my grandfather, his dad. It isn't a bad man and it was always a great provider for us when we were kids. He still takes care of mom. There are just some important things that I would never want to resemble in him. So I do the opposite...hehehe

Anyway, I really do love celebrating my birthday now. Last year, it was at Disney World. And since I wasn't able to work out a trip to Disneyland this year, I've decided to stick closer to home. I'll be having breakfast with Kerry in the morning after I've watch part of the Dodgers game. I'm also going to have dinner at Ford's Garage with that dining experience I think I may have mentioned before. If not, I just mentioned it...hehehe

For the time in between those meals, I'm planning to explore a few botanical gardens just south of me. It appears it will be a cooler day but really sunny. Kind of like how it was today. I'm charging my camera batteries to prepare for taking lots of photos...hehehe I'll also have my iPhone to take some photos that I can share instantly.
