The world tells me to do what feels good. It says that it's okay to put me first. It encourages me to do as much as I can because *you only live once (YOLO)*. That sounds pretty good, right?!?

Jesus tells me something completely different. He tells me to do what is right. He says I should seek His Kingdom first, loving God with all my heart. He encourages me to follow Him because, yes, I do indeed only live once. What would I profit to have gained the world but forfeit my soul!?!

Although I've always known what Jesus said, and for the most part tried to do that all my life with the exception of those few years I was away from the church...it wasn't until this past year, since October, that I've been open to seeking what that actually meant.
