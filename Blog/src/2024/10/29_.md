A new day dawns! A gloomy day outside...hehehe But I will still rejoice and be glad in it! After all, this is Florida. I imagine the sun will shine brightly in just a little bit...LOL

I didn't sleep well last night. Sometimes I don't really know why that happens. But I think this time it was because of the kind of day I had yesterday. I felt it was a good day. But it also triggered some of my overthinking toward the end right before bed. I feel as though my journal entry yesterday somewhat describes it well. It was a rollercoaster. I tend to look at the bright side these days. But I think my lack of good sleep is a good indicator that the rollercoaster I experienced yesterday wasn't so good after all.

I'll be okay, though. I have started this day with a great attitude! I do have a slight anxiety left over from yesterday. It is drawing me into prayer. I always see positive in praying...hehehe God cares about what I care about, right?!

Well, it's time to start my workday...hehehe
