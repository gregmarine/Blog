# TBD

Happy FriYAY!!! It's the last Friday of 2024. I'm really happy about the year. And I'm not sad it is coming to a close. Lord willing, 2025 will be here next week. I'm excited to continue this journey <3

I do not have a formal process for deciding what my goals are each year. I haven't ever really made New Year's resolutions or anything. But I do informally make some goals and themes for each year now, after my 2021 renaissance. 2022 was a year of escape. 2023 was a year of health and self-discovery with some self-awareness. 2024 has been a year of faith, hope, love and reconnecting with God. 2025...well, I believe I have settled in on simplicity and minimalism.

I attempted to be minimalistic at the end of 2021. But over the last few years, I tended to bring complexity to my life again. That's easy to do...LOL I hope to give simplicity a try again in 2025. I've been thinking and praying about this theme for a little bit. This morning, it came to me.

Again, this is an informal goal really. I'll make some plans to put this into action. But since the theme is *simplicity* and *minimalism*, I'm not going to over complicate this with a strategic plan...LOL I'll take small steps as I go along and see what happens throughout the year <3
