# Disney Christmas

Today is a doubleheader journal entry day...hehehe The other entry is a timestamp entry for my day. This one will be about my Disney Christmas yesterday. I failed to journal about Disney Thanksgiving. Which is perfectly fine. It wasn't my first time doing Disney for Thanksgiving. But this is my first Christmas at Disney. It is so special.

I went to bed *early* on Christmas Eve expecting that I'd want to get up early Christmas morning and *rope drop* Magic Kingdom. Early is relative. So, going to bed early just meant I wasn't going to stay up past midnight as I usually do. I think I was in bed by 10:30pm that night...hehehe So not that early for this timezone...LOL I think I was awake around 4am Christmas morning.

Being up that early was nice in that I didn't need to rush to get ready. I was able to do my morning routine, minus breakfast and coffee. I waited for those latter items for Disney...hehehe But I was able to do everything else at a nice pace. I was ready to walk out the door about 45 minutes before I needed to leave...hehehe

There wasn't any traffic to speak of on my way to Disney. That was to be expected. First of all, it was super early. Secondly, it was Christmas. There wouldn't have been the typical commuter traffic for those working in the Orlando area. I think it took about an hour and 45 minutes to get there using the back roads. I prefer the back roads for a few reasons. The back country of Florida is beautiful and it saves on fuel...hehehe

Arriving at Disney's Ticket and Transportation Center (TTC) so early meant I was able to get a great parking spot. It wasn't too far from security. I don't mind parking far now that I'm healthier. But I knew my day would be long and I'm glad I didn't have far to walk after such a long day...hehehe

After I made it through security, I headed over to the Joffrey's kiosk for a cup of coffee. I then headed to the fiery that goes across Seven Seas Lagoon. The wait on the boat before we set sail across the lagoon was so long that I drank the entire cup of coffee before we left the dock...LOL But that meant that I didn't need to hassle with that cup once I arrived at Magic Kingdom...hehehe

I arrived at MK shortly after 8am. Technically, I missed *rope drop*...LOL But that's okay. It was still early enough to count as at least being there about the time it opened. After I took some quick videos, I made my way to get my first set of PhotoPass pictures for the day! I enjoy doing the photos. I don't always like looking at them. I mostly do those to share with others. But it is fun to have them taken. I feel famous...LOL jk And the *magic shots* are always fun. It gives me the chance to feel *animated*...hehehe

Next, I made my way to a quick service to get some breakfast. Yeah, I'll not be doing that breakfast again. I went to *The Friar's Nook*. I had a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel with *potato barrels* (tater tots). Those were mid at best. I did enjoy the eggnog shake, though. I went there for the shake mostly. But I also had never been there before. So, I thought I'd try something new. A one and done experience for me...LOL
