# TBD

Wow! I just realized I've been writing a lot this month...LOL I haven't written this often since January. The few months prior to September were my least active months so far in this journal. But this month, I seem to have a lot to say...hehehe

I didn't title this one before writing. The title will come after I've finished writing for today. The last few days, I was a bit distracted by the hurricane. That is all over here now. It appears the storm is still impacting folks up north. So prayers continue for those folks and for those who will be recovering from this.

I haven't been on social media for a few days. I may check out my social feeds later today perhaps. It just wasn't a priority this week. I am feeling better about my place on social media, though. I'm just being me; which I always was. But I also felt this pressure I was putting on myself to keep the positivity flowing out there. Now, I'm finding rest when I need it. This week, my focus needed to be on safety. And I didn't want the distraction that social media can be sometimes.

Speaking of distractions, I'm finding less desire in seeking distraction. As I've been noticing the world distracting me from God, I also realized that I would sometimes seek distraction to avoid certain things in life. Or sometimes, it was just to seek temporary reprieve to reset. Distraction can be healthy sometimes, too, though. I just need to find the balance...hehehe
