# TBD

[I watched *The Chosen* S4E3 last night. In it, Ramah was stabbed through the back by Quintus. Of course, she died. She is played by Yasmine Al-Bustami. How she carried herself as the Ramah character reminded me of Chérie. When I first started watching *The Chosen*, I had a crush on Chérie. After we discussed whether or not she saw us ever being romantically involved, her response led me to settle the matter in my heart. I decided to let go of my crush. Although she is my very deer friend, she is not *mine* to hope for. She belongs to God. So my crush is no more. Watching the Ramah character pass away left with with a feeling of Peace as I knew she was going to be with God now. Sure, she's a fictional character. But the symbolism of someone I cared very much for being gone from my life for only a moment brought me Peace. I'll cherish my time with Chérie as my deer friend on our current path. But I am grateful that my heart is free from the agony of not having more of her. She is God's. And I will be standing by her side when we praise God together in Heaven.]: #

It is well with my soul. I don't really want to describe what happened last night. But something interesting happened. A calmness and peace flooded my soul beyond any I have experienced before. I would love to always feel that way...hehehe Alas, that isn't how life works...LOL I could go into great detail about what it is I saw/experienced and how I responded to it. But I feel as though it was a moment for just my memory. I am only bringing it up in my journal to hopefully be a reminder someday that, although the sword may cut through the back of expectation, we should remain with Him always without any doubts about His Love. *With an attitude of gratitude, let's accept what is meant for us today. And reject what isn't!* (Today's Vitamin G)
