## Magical Renewal

Well, it's official! I've renewed by Walt Disney World Annual Pass for another year...hehehe Although I still had some reservations as to whether or not I should renew, I ultimately decided it was a good idea. If I go there at least once per month, it pays for itself anyway. And it is most likely that I will go more than once each month, if I'm honest about it...LOL
