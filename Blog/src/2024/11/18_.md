I'm really glad I walked so much when I was in California the week before last. Although my eating habits weren't great on that trip, my walking habit was in full motion...hehehe That kept me moving when I returned. And I've continue with that strongly today.

I remember when I heard the Spirit tell me to get up and walk in January 2023. I'm glad I listened to God's Voice that day. The spiritual, mental, and physical health journey I've been on since has been beyond anything I imagined back then. I'm nearly two years into this. I'm so excited that God has given me the strength to keep going. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know how long it would take. Being where I am today made it all worth it.

I've continued my discipline of eating at home. Some of my meals have been quite simple. Those are good when I don't feel like doing much food prep. But I've also made meals that required multiple cooking sessions. I've tried some new (to me) things as well. I'm mostly the type to just throw things together because it sounds good. There's a little bit of food science. As well as a lot of trial and error. I'm really pleased to be eating all of my meals at home, though. It is considerably cheaper and so much better for my health.
