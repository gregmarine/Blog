# TBD

I've missed journaling these past few days. Alas, I've been preoccupied these past few evenings.

On Wednesday, it was the *First Wednesday* worship service at church. I'm so grateful for that service each month. I'm also grateful God prompted me to set a reminder. Although I was thinking about it at the beginning of the week, when Wednesday arrived, I had forgotten it was even Wednesday...hehehe At 5pm, my reminder went off and was very glad it did!

I love to worship God in that community of fellow believers. And what is normally a brief message from a pastor was a full sermon by our lead pastor, Pastor Q. I'm looking forward to this next series of messages. It is about becoming a rock. Essentially, standing firm on my faith and not allowing the world to influence my decisions. Instead, being influenced by the Word of God, through prayer, and giving thanks through worship. The timing for this lesson is spot on for where I am in my own walk of faith. I often wonder who else in my church community here are on the same path as myself.

Worship continued after the message and actually continued after the congregation was dismissed. There were several of us who remained and the worship team continued to worship. I ended up on my literal knees during this extended time and lamented to God about these past 25 years. I cried out for forgiveness over how I have been trying to live on my own understanding instead of His. I'm ready to spend the next 25 years with a Kingdom focus instead of a *Greg* focus. The past 25 years certainly have not been wasted. God is still using those years. It's just, as a human, I still feel some regret for how I have lived. I'm very glad to have had that moment on Wednesday to repent.

Last night, Kerry came over. I've missed having these Thursday session with him. Between his vacation and my own, it had been quite a while since we had met on a Thursday. We started meeting about a year ago every other Thursday for a Bible study. It then evolved into a close friendship that eventually led us to meeting almost every Thursday. This has given us both a safe place to discuss what is going on in each other's lives and to pray for each other.

This time, I did most of the talking. It isn't typically that way. But I had a lot on my heart that just needed to get out. He already knew that was the case and was the one who asked me about it. I am so thankful he was there to listen and to pray with me about it all. Well, 2 main things. But it was great to get all of it out last night. I usually bottle things up. I am sure we all do that. Sometimes, it is nice to open that bottle, though.
