# TBD

This has been a much better week than last week. When I am able to identify a possible reason for my emotions, I'm able to better understand them and figure out how to course correct. The same is true for when I am able to identify my personality treats, passions, and abilities. But then I struggle with how to balance it all...hehehe

Balance has been a theme and key component for my life. When things are out of balance, I start to wobble and fall over. When things are in balance, I can remain stable and upright. I wonder how I can begin to identify when things are about to go out of balance so I can prevent my life from becoming unbalanced?..hmmm
