## Light

The message on Sunday at theChapel resonated with me. I've been processing it these last few days to prepare myself to write about it. So many messages I've heard there, or at CCGS lately, seem to be a direct answer to prayer. The message, *More Light Required*, was one such message.

::: details Luke 11:33-36 AMP
> “No one lights a lamp and then puts it in a cellar nor under a basket [hiding the light], but [instead it is put] on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light. The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear [spiritually perceptive, focused on God], your whole body also is full of light [benefiting from God’s precepts]. But when it is bad [spiritually blind], your body also is full of darkness [devoid of God’s word]. Be careful, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. So if your whole body is illuminated, with no dark part, it will be entirely bright [with light], as when the lamp gives you light with its bright rays.”

In his message, Pastor Jason talked about how we can miss something important if we don't have enough light. His analogy used the concept of our mobile phone cameras when attempting to capture a precious moment and how the camera will sometimes notify us that more light is required. The message then applied how Jesus helps how we see other people, our path, and our problems.

With other *people*, more light is required for discernment.

With my *path*, more light is required for direction.

With my *problems*, more light is required to see danger.

He further went on to explain when we shine the light we've taken in, people in darkness will see Jesus.
