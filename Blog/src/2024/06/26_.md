# TBD

Happy Stitch Day! Hehehe Today is one of those made up Disney holidays...LOL Stitch is experiment 626 in the *Lilo & Stitch* franchise. So June 26th (6/26) became Stitch Day...HAHAHA He's one of Malachi's favorite characters. I think my nephews also have him as a favorite. And, my sister-in-law's birthday is today...hehehe Happy Birthday to her!

I use to have a business making Disney-inspired stuff using my 3D modeling and printing skills. If I ever do that again, I'll need to be sure to keep a calendar of all the Disney-inspired *holidays* and events to get people excited about my products...LOL Some of my favorite things I made back then were from *Lilo & Stitch*. I especially loved the hibiscus Mickey/Minnie ears I created...hehehe

Realizing I’m exactly where I am meant to be and I have exactly what I’m meant to have in this exact moment is a very freeing feeling. Finding contentment truly has been a blessing. I still don't feel this way 100% of the time. But it has been this way more often than not lately. It's is one of those things I really hope is becoming a lifestyle and not just a season.

With contentment being a daily, and often moment to moment choice, I think all I need to do is develop mindful habits to remind myself to remain grateful. I've recently had a few reminders that my circumstances aren't really what I want all of the time. But I keep reminding myself that I can still choose to be joyful about everything. When I start to see what I don't have that I desire, I can refocus and see what I do have is still quite amazing.

I've tried hard not to ask God for things I desire lately. I'm not sure that is the right approach. It does seem to keep me humble. Yet, is it something I should be avoiding? I suppose it depends on the motives. I think the reason I'm avoiding it now is because there were so many times I'd ask for a desire and the answer would be *no* or *not yet*. I need to be okay with those answers. I need to drop my fear of rejection, don't I? God wants me to tell Him what I want, doesn't He?

When I consider that He so often provides better things for me than even what I desire, perhaps I just need to learn to ask for the better desires. Perhaps I should be asking Him to help me with my desires? I think the next evolution of my choosing joy each day is to begin to figure out how to also choose better desires and wants. Going beyond being okay with *no* or *not yet* and start desiring what I have in the moment.

I found out that the colleague I mentioned the other day is getting extended through the end of July now. Just 2 days ago, he was looking at this being his last week with the company. Now, he's going to be around for another month...LOL I am reminded today that the only constant in life is change...hehehe I'm happy to get to continue working with him for another month. And I hope this change in status is a good thing for him.

I noticed something about my routine this week. This sort of just happened and I believe it is a result of how I've been doing my schedule this month. I have become so efficient with my lunch hour that I now make and eat my lunch, do that day's *Bible in a Year* reading session, and go for a mile walk at an exercise pace. I don't feel rushed to get all of that done. It just happens. I really love this and hope it becomes a habit. If could even evolve into part of my lifestyle. We shall see...hehehe

Today's *The Chosen* devotional (book 2, day 22) was another one of those *mind's eye* opening messages. It wasn't exactly about what I was talking about above. But it did spark a thought about what I said concerning not asking God for what I desire. Perhaps it isn't about me having the wrong desires. Perhaps I'm just not confident in what I desire. Or more accurately, I'm not confident God will give me what I desire because I feel unworthy.

Well, that's not how Grace works...hehehe Not that I really know how Grace works. But one thing I do know is that it isn't about my worthiness...LOL I suppose I just found it difficult to accept that God, or anyone for that matter, can possible love me. Years of abuse can do that to a person. I'm glad I'm learning to let that go...hehehe I'm finally accepting that some very important people in my life do, in fact, love me. I'm grateful for their love. God is using this love to remind me of how much He loves me. The simple truth is, He loves me more than anyone else does.

If I can remain humble, I can approach Him with confidence concerning my desires. Of course, I'll have to accept that He'll say *no* or *not yet* still. And I can accept His Will regardless because He always provides what is best. Sometimes my desires will align with His Will. But when it does not, He'll have something much better for me.

Pain update: I'm feeling much better today. I haven't had to use any pain management yet today. I'll probably take it for bedtime, though. Getting a good night's sleep is very important...hehehe I'm just thankful the pain has improved. I've also been able to get in some exercise every day this week.

I've been able to watch tonight's Dodgers game against the White Sox. If they win tonight, it will be a sweep. Since I'll be in California next week, I've decided to get a *teekit* in honor of the sweep. I'm grateful I get to watch the game tonight. I don't get to see many of them...hehehe Gavin Stone has been pitching the whole game. He has done an excellent job. He and the team have kept the White Sox at bay.

Well, Gavin Stone achieved a shutout! And the Dodgers sweep the White Sox!!! Yay!!! I'm getting a *teekit*!!!
