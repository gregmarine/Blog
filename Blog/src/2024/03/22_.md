# TBD

This has been quite the week. So much to write about that I wonder if I actually will...hehehe Sometimes I want to write and don't simply because some of my experiences need to remain in a place of my heart that no one else will ever see and that I'll bring back to remembrance without being prompted by what I wrote *today*. Sometimes, when I experience the same joy or pain at a later time, moments like what I'm referring to will come back through relatable emotions. There is something so intimate about that, you know?

The first thing I want to talk about today is actually something I wrote a letter about and decided not to send. I wrote the letter to process my thoughts and feelings on the matter. Partly to prepare myself for discussing the situation with my parents. But also to get the thoughts from whom I wrote the letter to. I'm not going to mention any names today because today's journal entry is about my own thoughts and feelings completely. Although I shared some experiences this week, there are so many other experiences from the week that I experienced solely with God. I'm writing about them today because I really need to process it all.

That's what I do when I write. Writing has given me the opportunity to get out my thoughts and feelings in a medium that allows me to meditate over everything I feel and think. This has been such a transformable year in this regard. Never before have I ever written so much. Some of it can be used for other purposes. While some of it is just rambling.

Before I continue, I want to reassure you that I am doing really well with what I’m about to talk about. God has always been and will always be my provider. I have faith in His plan. What I do for a living is merely one detail on the ledger of that plan. I’m not anxious about my situation whatsoever. It is both freeing, and a little weird to feel okay…LOL Also, I did not lose my job yesterday…

I received the news that, as of now, I have not been chosen to move over to the new company. The new company is definitely taking most of my team. However, there are a few of us who aren’t as vital to the specific reasons the team is moving. In my case, there is reason to believe that the new company already has resources that fit the skill set I have. With a limited budget, that company did not feel I was essential.

This does not yet mean I will be without a job later this year. There remains the likelihood of my skills fitting a different team within my existing company. However, with all of the other changes in the works, this is not a certainty either. The analogy presented to me was that the company is somewhat like the Titanic sinking. There are several lifeboats being deployed and they will see about finding room on one of them for me. Unlike the Titanic, however, the entire ship isn’t going down. There will be a much smaller ship remaining even after all of the lifeboats are deployed, if that makes sense?

So, this news yesterday answered the first question: “Will I be moving to the new company?” *No*. That answer now presents me with a whole new set of questions…LOL Is there a lifeboat for me? Will there still be room for me on that smaller ship after everything settles down? When will all of these other changes be taking place that affect those questions? How long do I have before I’ll know if/when I’ll be without any options? And I was also presented with another question concerning that new company who does not want me…hehehe

My boss was selected to move over. He asked me if I would like him to advocate on my behalf with the new company to convince them to take me. This is the most immediate question that I need to answer by the end of the day today (Friday). It is more of a question of whether or not I want to pursue other opportunities outside of all of this or give him some time to see what he can do.

Wednesday, I was presented with such an outside opportunity. A friend of mine who works for Disney sent me a job posting that peeked my interest. It was for a management position overseeing a software development team for the theme parks. I believe it is the dining reservation system. I’m praying to see if the timing was mere coincidence or divine providence. It isn’t enough for me that it is *Disney*. I want my decisions about all of this to be about God’s Will.

Regardless, I still have months ahead. I did not lose my job yesterday. The uncertainties just still remain. I need prayer about discernment considering this matter. I also hope the Peace remains in my heart. I do not want this to lead to anxieties. I don’t think it will. But I’m human. It is tempting to be anxious…hehehe

I spoke with my boss first thing when I started work. I wanted to ask him how he felt about the new company not wanting me right away and how adamant he was in convincing the new company that I was vital to his team. He expressed his disappointment and that he felt very strongly that he wanted me to come along. So I told him that I would appreciate his advocacy with his soon to be new boss. In the meantime, I will also be exploring all of my other options, including outside opportunities.
