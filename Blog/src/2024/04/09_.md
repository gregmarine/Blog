## Light

The message on Sunday at theChapel resonated with me. I've been processing it these last few days to prepare myself to write about it. So many messages I've heard there, or at CCGS lately, seem to be a direct answer to prayer. The message, *More Light Required*, was one such message.

::: details Luke 11:33-36 AMP
> “No one lights a lamp and then puts it in a cellar nor under a basket [hiding the light], but [instead it is put] on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light. The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear [spiritually perceptive, focused on God], your whole body also is full of light [benefiting from God’s precepts]. But when it is bad [spiritually blind], your body also is full of darkness [devoid of God’s word]. Be careful, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. So if your whole body is illuminated, with no dark part, it will be entirely bright [with light], as when the lamp gives you light with its bright rays.”
