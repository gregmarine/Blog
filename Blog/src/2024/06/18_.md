## Not a Test

I'm learning quite a bit this year...hehehe I'm really excited about all this life is teaching me. For a while, I thought I was a failure at so many things. I'd mentally beat myself up over every little thing I messed up in my life. That negative self-talk created a landfill style landscape in my mind that made it difficult to feel any sort of love for the good parts about who I am. I received a text this morning that sounded like something I use to tell myself when I was struggling with the darkest moments of my life. I'll dissect it here in a bit. But it prompted me to think about how my thought life as changed these last 3-4 years; especially the improvements occurring this year. I'll likely turn this into Vitamin G someday...hehehe As for today, it is a poem...

I use to feel like a failure.
But life is a lesson.
I'm still learning.
This is not a test.

I'm still growing.
I'm accountable for my own actions.
I'm not accountable for anyone else.
This is not a test.

I fall down and get back up.
I don't keep trying.
I keep doing.
This is not a test.

I apply the lessons I'm learning.
I keep moving forward.
It isn't about passing or failing.
This is not a test.

The past is gone.
The future isn't here yet.
All I have is now.
This is not a test.

It's just homework.
Preparing me for what's next.
I'm to make the most of what I have today.
This is not a test.

## Text from ~~redacted~~

Jesus revealed to me this morning that I alone was at fault for what went down on Sunday. I woke up feeling rebellious, because I wasn’t getting love and respect on Father’s Day. The spirit reminded me how I’ve hurt my family for the last 17 years and that honor and respect needs to be earned. He also reminded me that seeking human praise and glory is sin. It is self serving. 

God deserves the honor and glory for every thing that He orchestrates in my life. I am a worm. He is God.

## Great Expectations Revisited

"Who hurt you?"

"My own expectations."
