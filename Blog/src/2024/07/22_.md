> Some people leave fingerprints on our hearts. They have touched us in such a way that they have left a lasting and positive impact on our lives. I’m going to cherish their fingerprints on my heart today.

Today's *Vitamin G* was inspired by something similar I said about a year ago. When I think about this from time to time, there is always someone who immediate comes to mind. His name is Jerry B. It passed away some time ago. But his impact on my life keeps him alive in my heart. I never quite knew what he saw in me back in the 90s. He was a mentor and a friend. Someone who always put the truth in trust. When we met, he was my boss. Yet, he didn't treat me like an employee. I was a member of his team. He led by example. That sort of boss. More of a leader than a ruler. He corrected me when I needed that but also inspired when that was what was needed. I just now realized that my current boss, Ross H., reminds me of Jerry in a lot of ways.

I've had several people I can think of that left a lasting and positive impact on my life. Some have passed away and some are still alive. Of those who are alive, not all of them remain a part of my life today. But that doesn't change their impact. I get to carry these wonderful souls with me through fond and cherished memories. Of those who do remain in my life today, I make an effort to let them know how much I appreciate them. They reciprocate. It's an important bond.

I'm glad I was reminded about that inspiring thought yesterday. When I tie it back to my feelings of loneliness earlier this year, I realize I shouldn't feel those emotions. It's okay to feel that way. I'm just saying the feelings aren't rooted in reality or truth. I'm not truly alone. God is with me always. But God has also provided me technology to remain close to the people I love.

Over the past 10 days, I've spoken with Malachi, I think 8 of those days. He needed some talk time with his dad...hehehe But truth be told, his dad needed talk time with him too..LOL Also, last night's call with mom and dad was much longer than we typically talk. Most of the conversation was random. But it was a Blessing. Mom is having surgery tomorrow. It should go smoothly. But it is major replacement surgery. So, there is still a great deal of risk involved. God has her in His hands. I'm just glad we were able to talk for so long last night. I'm not concerned about losing my parents. But I'm going to cherish each and every phone call I can make with them. To be clear, my lack of concern is only because I know where we are all headed...hehehe God's Kingdom is the destination. It can still be scary to lose parents. Not being concerned doesn't mean I'm not a little scared sometimes. I'm a lot scared sometimes too. I'm glad for that, actually. It keeps me making those phone calls...hehehe

Also, I have had the opportunity to do FaceTime with Dan the past few Thursdays. He lives just far enough away that it takes planning to meet up...hehehe It's a little over a 2 hour drive...basically further away than Disney. But with FaceTime, we are able to hang out for a few hours without the small *burden* of 4-5 hours of drive time (total there and back). I've called him this, and if one believes in such a thing, I'd classify him as my *best* friend. He's my Proverbs 18:24b *friend who is closer than a brother*. But considering that I have had a few friends over the year I called my *best* friend, I think I'm going to drop that title...hehehe

Speaking of FaceTime, or Google Meet, Chérie and I have regular video calls too. It was wonderful getting to spend time together in person a few weeks ago. But Google Meet and FaceTime aren't any less meaningful. Being more than 2k miles apart, I'm so grateful God provides us the technology to remain connected. On our call yesterday, we were even able to do our devotional face to face. We did that in LA at the Walt Disney Concert Hall for the first time. It is going to be nice doing that on the days of our video calls now too.

I got a text from my neighbor, Olga, from across the breezeway this morning. She asked if I could come over. As I wasn't in a meeting, I dropped by. Last night there was a lightning strike in our complex that set off our fire alarm. Apparently it also caused her living room circuit breaker to trip...hehehe She was having difficulty opening her breaker box. This was the first time one of her breakers had tripped since she moved in. So it was probably the first time the box door was being opened since it was installed...hehehe I jarred it loose and now she is able to open it herself. I reset the breaker for her living room and said, *and God said, 'Let there be light'*...LOL She was grateful and she also thanked me for making her feel better about not being able to open the breaker box door. I explained that it was a little jammed since it hadn't been opened before...hehehe She asked if she could give me a hug...and...you guessed it...I gladly accepted the hug...LOL I like warm hugs...hehehe

Fun fact: Olga was born the same year as my grandmother and she shares a birthday with Malachi...hehehe Both are a fun little connection between us.
