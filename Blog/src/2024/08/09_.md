# TBD

A great sadness came over me this morning. I was actually brought to tears. It was somewhat out of nowhere, actually. Perhaps how happy I've been lately has been hiding something deep down that finally bubbled up...hehehe Well, I immediately started to pray and invoke the Name of Jesus when I started to cry. It didn't take long for His Peace to comfort my soul and then I suddenly found myself doing some Bible research on a few topics. So, what began as great sadness turned into Joy. And it set a momentum for the rest of the day. It turned out to be a fantastic Friday...hehehe
