## Behind the Curtain

I can be viewed as a thinker. And in many ways, I am actually an over thinker...hehehe (Side note, you'll see me say *hehehe*, *HAHAHA*, or *LOL* quite a bit in this journal...I literally make those sounds or expressions in real life. So I make it a part of my writer's voice here as well.) I naturally have a curious mind. I attempt to analyze most things to better understand my world. I'm quite often trying to figure things out. Beginning in 2024, I wanted to document the seemingly randomness of what I think about and how I think about most things. *So, I was thinking...* is a look *behind the curtain of a curious mind*. My mind. The thoughts and feelings written on these pages are mine, and mine alone.

Depending on how much you read through my journal, you may come across contradictory concepts or statements. That's okay. This can be considered a living site. Each time I write, I'm expressing my thoughts and feelings in the moment. I could write about the same topic multiple times and have new insight each time. Something I think or feel today may in fact be so different than how I thought or felt in the past that what I say *today* can be the complete opposite of what I said *yesterday*. I am human. I am growing. I am *a work in progress...making progress*.
