# Read Me First

## Welcome

If this is your first visit to my online journal (blog), welcome! If you have been here before and this is your first time reading this entry or you are reading it again, welcome back! The purpose of this entry is introduce you to what this site is and hopefully add some clarity to it's true purpose.

## Behind the Curtain

I can be viewed as a thinker. And in many ways, I am actually an over thinker...hehehe (Side note, you'll see me say *hehehe*, *HAHAHA*, or *LOL* quite a bit in this journal...I literally make those sounds or expressions in real life. So I make it a part of my writer's voice here as well.) I naturally have a curious mind. I attempt to analyze most things to better understand my world. I'm quite often trying to figure things out. Beginning in 2024, I wanted to document the seemingly randomness of what I think about and how I think about most things. *So, I was thinking...* is a look *behind the curtain of a curious mind*. My mind. The thoughts and feelings written on these pages are mine, and mine alone.
