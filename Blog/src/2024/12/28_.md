This has been a rough day...LOL I actually mean that in a good way...LOL Sounds funny to say that. But something I've learned is that even bad things are good if they lead me to the good; which bad things always seem to do...LOL Okay, that may seem a little dramatic. But it's how I feel today.

Once again, I'm recovering from the food I ate in Indiana. It would seem my body is much more sensitive than it used to be because I'm finally eating actual healthy foods for the first time in my life. It's as if a have these little demons inside me that are starving. When I eat something bad, they get their energy back and start to wage war on my body...LOL A small cheat every once in a while doesn't seem to impact me. But a weekend in Indiana where all of the meals are bad...well, brace me for impact...LOL

Although I knew I wasn't feeling well, I still ate popcorn at the movies. It's just something I typically do and don't think about it. After today, I'm going to start thinking long and hard about it and tell my craving *nooooooooo*...LOL Back in January, I finally broke my sweet tooth. So I don't have any candy at the movies anymore. I need to cut popcorn out...even the healthy stuff I make myself at home. I need to break the craving so I don't get tempted at the movies. Or at least, I need to pay attention to the way out of that temptation when it comes a knockin'...LOL

This has been affecting my sleep as well. I keep having weird dreams. And last night, my right foot gave me all kinds of trouble. The pain I feel seems to be in joints and muscle. I also get the pain in my back. I've narrowed it down to the food I ate in Indiana. Some might think I'm crazy. But I've been listening to my body pretty closely for almost 2 years now. It is screaming and pointing at that food...LOL
