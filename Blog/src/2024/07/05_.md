# TBD

Today was quite a bit different from yesterday...hehehe I didn't climb any mountains...LOL I attempted to go to Azusa Wilderness Park. However, when I got to the road it is on, the road was closed. I'm unlikely to attempt going again on this trip. I'm leaning toward the Arboretum for Sunday. But I'm unsure of even that. It is going to be hotter this weekend I think. Hotter than hot seems like an indoor kinda of day...LOL

Since Azusa Wilderness Park didn't work out, I set my sights on seeing how easy it was to get to Union Station. It was super easy to get to...hehehe I had concerns about driving into LA. I don't normally like to drive into major cities. Well, it wasn't too bad for me. Once I got to Union Station, I decided to drive by The Last Bookstore to get a feel for the area it is in. I didn't have any issues driving through that part of the city either. The city didn't seem very busy today. There weren't even a lot of people walking around. I noticed some of the parking areas around this part as well. It doesn't seem as bad as I thought it might be for me. It felt sort of like Indianapolis. It isn't totally the same...but I think I could manage it if I live here.

After driving by The Last Book Store, I set my sights on Santa Monica Pier. I really wanted to see the Pacific Ocean for the first time on this trip. I was able to get there pretty quickly and I was able to park right there next to the pier. As I approached, I was able to see the ocean. I was really happy to get to see it from the road...hehehe I almost decided to skip the pier because my only goal was to see the ocean...LOL But then I realized the pier was right there...so why not?!?...hehehe

The pier was crowded. And it was chilly...LOL I had to wear my jacket. I am so glad I brought it. I would have been too cold to enjoy it otherwise. It was so weird. Back near the hotel, it was around 90. At the ocean, it was 69. The cool breeze off of the water made it feel even chillier. When the sun came out, it felt better. But it was mostly overcast. So the sun didn't make much of an appearance there...hehehe

After I snapped some photos of the ocean, I had lunch at MariaSol. It's a Mexican restaurant near the end of the pier. I went with the Baja Fish Tacos. They were pretty good and I'd recommend them. The view from there wasn't great. I think that's because it wasn't on the edge of the pier. There is still part of the pier beyond the restaurant where people can gather. So the view was a sea of people...LOL

After lunch, I walked around the pier to take some photos and videos. With the hazy overcast weather, the photos weren't great. I didn't even take out my mirror-less camera. I just used my iPhone. I went down onto the beach and took some photos and videos under the pier. That was pretty cool. I had never been under a pier before...hehehe As I was on the beach, I realized my neck was being exposed to the UV rays. So I put my hoodie up. I looked like a thug...LOL That's when I got my thug mug out of there...hehehe

I went back to my hotel to recenter myself after driving around so much. I was doing fine. I just needed to take a moment to decide what I wanted to do next without trying to do so while driving. After the disappointment of Azusa Wilderness Park being closed, I just used speech to navigate on my Apple CarPlay and went where it navigated me to...hehehe So, it was time to get back to basecamp and regroup...hehehe
