## Museum Park

Last night after work, I went to an art museum park that had giant sculptures throughout the property and several trails. I had very limited time there. It's definitely a place I'd like to visit again. The park was beautiful and was quite large. It was in a very nice part of Raleigh. The park was free and several people were enjoying it.

With limited time, I just sort of meandered through a few of the trails. I saw most of the sculptures, though. And I even came across some deer...hehehe Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.

I did have one brief moment of heart break come over me while I was there. It made me sad for that moment. But then I looked to my right. There it was...I warm hug, just for me...hehehe I eventually captured it through my lens. But I stood there in awe for a bit. I'm not sure if I'll ever share the photograph I took. God gave me a sense of Peace in that moment and the heaviness of my heart was lifted from me.

I think part of it is that I don't know where I belong. I'm basically without a home right now. Or at least a sense of home. And I'm not quite sure where I fit into God's plans anymore. It's as if I'm lost. Seeing that warm hug reminded me that I should take heart and know that God is always with me. I'm not actually lost. My home is where ever God is; which is everywhere. And as long as I'm here on earth, I'm a part of His plan. My feelings have been lying to me lately...hehehe Actually, I don't think that's what is really going on. It is more like I don't know how I should feel...hehehe

Since I love art, I'm glad I saw all of the wonderful creations last night. With limited time, I didn't take the opportunity to read all of the signs for what I saw. I'll eventually go back and take the time to take it all in. I'd also like to visit the actual museum sometime.

Here is a small photo dump from last night:
