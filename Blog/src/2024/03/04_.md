One of the nice things about being along in this time of my life is I have a great amount of time to reflect. That can also be a curse...hehehe But today, I'm going to focus on the positive side of this. That is one of the many things God has been working on in my life. He has been helping me focus on the positives.

Lately, I have been reflecting on those relationships I have that are uplifting. Those that add to my life as opposed to taking something away. And conversely, which relationships where I add to their life as opposed to taking something away from them.

This isn't limited to relationships that are ongoing, either. Even with a once in a lifetime interaction, a sort of relationship is formed in some way. Even simply smiling at a random stranger can leave an impact on that stranger that they carry with them the rest of their life.

Each interaction I have with others provides me an opportunity to learn what can add to someone's life and what could take away from them. I do not always know what impact I have made on someone. In fact, that isn't ever really for me to know. My responsibility is to always grow as a person and child of God with each impact I make.

Something I am learning in these reflections is that the trauma I've experienced has given me too strong an appreciation of the little things. That may sound slightly odd, but please allow me to explain.
