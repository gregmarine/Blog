# TBD

Today was my last full day on this adventure. And what a great day it was! But I'll admit, I'm not sad that this is my last. I'm already dreaming about my next visit...hehehe I would like to make this a regular thing...except maybe not in the summer again...hehehe I was fine with the heat. But it was a bit hot for Ch√©rie yesterday. And also, the crowds were a bit much for me. But none of that is the point of today's journal entry...so let's get started!

I skipped breakfast today...LOL I was too excited to be at church to deal with trying to fit breakfast in before going. Breakfast at the hotel didn't start until 7am today and church started at 8am. I didn't want to feel rushed. I got to the church a bit early. I actually always do that...hehehe I think I was there around 7:40ish. That service isn't packed. So I probably could have had breakfast and gotten there at 7:55 and would have been okay.

The service went well as usual. I felt a little out of place, though. I like to move a lot when I worship. So I felt a little restrained today. I actually felt that way on Wednesday as well. I'm not sure I mentioned it...hehehe Worship isn't about how I feel, though. It is about acknowledging the subject of my affection...God. I no longer allow the song choices, how well the band plays, how well the singers sings, or how much movement the congregation is accustomed to, to affect my worship. It's all about the heart of worship. I've wrestled with this throughout my life. Knowing who it is I'm worship is making the different. I'm basically saying that I'm not performing...hehehe And I have an audience of 1...God Himself. May my song be an offering to my King...hehehe

The sermon was the first in what Pastor Raul is calling a series on Angels & Demons. He read from Genesis 3 today.
