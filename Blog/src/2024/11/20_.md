# TBD

Unintentionally, I stumbled into a well balanced routine once again...hehehe I had a well tuned routine I established in July that was disrupted by hurricanes, among other things, in September through October. I pretty much gave up on trying to reestablish my preferred routine and started just going with whatever the day would bring. Aside from my major responsibilities such as work, of course.

Well, my California trip seems to have reset me a bit...LOL These past few weeks have been a return of a well tuned and balanced set of tasks that leave me feeling great most days. I hadn't planned on any of it. It all sort of just happened. Yesterday and today, I observed I had been doing the same things every day since my return. Sure, it hasn't been that long. But the fact I've pretty much held to the same schedule every day was a bit of a surprise.

Last Thanksgiving, I did an Olaf Disney bound outfit for my Friendsgiving at EPCOT. I wore a brown long sleeve (to present Olaf's branch arms), I white shirt over the brown that had three large black *coals*, and a hat that I made a comical branch coming out of to represent an Olaf head of *hair*. I also wore black round lens sunglasses to represent Olaf eyes. But I only wore those in the sun. It was cute and really fun! I got a lot of compliments. At the end of the day, I was at the Port Orleans Riverside resort and a family noticed me. The mother pointed over at me and told her small children that I was Olaf. It warmed my heart...hehehe I have since worn this outfit just for fun...LOL Including on Halloween this year.

Although not directly related, the joy that brought me led to me joining in on the fun at this years Spring Dapper Day at EPCOT in April. I was on the fence about it leading up to the day. But I remembered how fun it was being Olaf on Thanksgiving. I didn't bound as a character. But dressing up for a day at the park was just as exciting as doing a Disney bound.
