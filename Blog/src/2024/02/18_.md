## Vitamin G

Today's Vitamin G has been a sort of theme for this past year. All of the progress I've made personally can pretty much be summed up in what God inspired me to say today. The scripture behind it mainly comes from John 5:2-8,

> Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?” The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.” Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”

With that scripture in heart, these were the words I told myself:

> Do I want to be healed? I’ve made every excuse not to answer that in the affirmative. No more excuses, Greg! Get up and walk! No, get up and RUN! You are free!

I've been doing these posts on social media for just over 3 years now. It was almost 4 years ago when I started to apply this. It is good to think about such things. It provides me encouragement to keep going. When the weight of the negativity starts to creep in, I need to remind myself, *...do I want to be healed?*

## Rebuilding

I revisited my thoughts on how I have rebuilt my life several times. Yes, I'm tired. But the more I thought about it last night and this morning, that's all I am. Just tired. I still have the sense of excitement in starting over. After all, I'm always starting over with experience!

The reason I kept thinking about this after I journaled yesterday is that I love change. Change can bring about anxiety for me. But I really do enjoy how it makes me grow. I remember how I felt on my most recent major change. I left the region of the country I had always lived in and relocated myself to Florida.

Making such a drastic change really sent my anxieties into a tailspin. It seems like things were out of control at the time. I recall it vividly because it really wasn't that long ago. About 22 months ago. I said that in months to make it seem like it was longer...hehehe So, less than 2 years ago...LOL

I'd say I'm tired today because of how much energy that took. It was hard. I'd never made just a drastic change in my life. And it wasn't gradual. I just had to trust that God knew what He was doing by calling me down here.

Bringing my thoughts back to rebuilding. I probably should have said that I'll gladly keep rebuilding every time God needs me to. I'm not sure I should look at making my *life purpose statement* as the final draft of the rest of my life. Change has been a theme for me life. I'll be thankful if I never have to rebuild. And I'll be thankful if I do.

## SUNDAY!!!
