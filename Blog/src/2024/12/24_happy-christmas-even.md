# Happy Christmas Eve

It's so exciting that another Christmas Eve has arrived! This has been a special day for me most of my life. For many years, it was the day my extended family would celebrate Christmas together. When that changed, it became the day my parents would celebrate it with my brother's and my families. Now, it's neither of those things...LOL But it remains an important day in my heart for various reasons. One of those being it is the anniversary of when I gave my heart to Jesus <3

I'm actually working today...LOL But later today, I'll be enjoying Christmas services with CUMC out of Virginia Beach and a Christmas video call with Cherie. Although this isn't our first Christmas as friends, it is the first one with us being in a fellowship and where we exchange gifts with a video call...hehehe So, this year's Christmas Eve gets to be added to the main reasons I love Christmas Eve so much <3

Christmas Day itself has been different for me most years after my childhood. In a way, I haven't kept it as special in my heart as it's Eve. But in another way, I suppose that means it is special in that the only thing about it that has been constant is that I celebrate our Savior's birth. This year's has become super special for me as I piggy back off of what happened in my heart back on Easter. Back then, I pondered how I can celebrate Easter. God transformed my heart then and I'm carrying that into this Christmas tomorrow.

I've talked about my past hangups with celebrating these holidays as *religious* holidays...LOL I'm grateful God answered our prayers about this. He's helped me find a balance between the *flesh* and the *spiritual* aspects of my celebration. First of all, it isn't about *meeeeeee*...LOL It's all about Him. Second of all, everything about us wells up from the heart. If I keep my heart in the right place, there isn't any wrong way for me to celebrate these as Holy Holidays.

I love that 26 years ago I gave my heart to Jesus in a United Methodist Church. Today, I celebrate Christmas at a United Methodist Church. My path between that night and tonight wasn't a straight one...hehehe But nonetheless, God has been with me at all times. And I'm grateful for all he has done. And I am grateful for connections such at these I'm experiencing today.
