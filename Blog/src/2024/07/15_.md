# TBD

A few days ago, I wrote about effort. I wanted to clarify something about that before I wrote today's journal entry. I was speaking about the personal choice to apply myself to whatever it was I'm putting effort into. Not to be confused with what it physically takes. The idea came to mind while I was jogging. Over the weekend, I got to thinking about how it may have sounded like I was referring to pushing myself physically to run faster or harder than the day before. I was not. I was referring to the condition of my heart and mind. It was more a matter of spiritual and mental health than it was my physical. I somewhat think my messages about last year and my health journey come across about the physical aspects. Honestly, I'm typically speaking more about the spiritual and mental. The physical is impacted by the other two, and vice versa. It is all a dance of balancing the three. However, in the context of effort as it applied the other day, the effort on my mind each day is how much of myself I put into what I'm doing. Instead of simply going through the motions, I want to apply the core of who I am. That's what makes it all worth the effort for me. I hope that answers more questions than it creates...hehehe
