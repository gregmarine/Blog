# Weird, Normal, and My Best

## That was weird

I went to bed pretty early last night. And it didn't take me long to get to sleep. I was completely out well before 9pm. Around 10:20pm, I woke up with the feeling that I might have some stomach issues. Considering my recent change in diet, I somewhat expected to have some sort of stomach distress. But false alarm!

It took a bit to get back to sleep after that. But I think I was back out before 11pm. I know I dreamt quite a bit throughout the night. I don't recall much about what I dreamt, though. The weird thing is I didn't wake up until about 6:40am! I had about 9 hours of sleep total. I have no idea why I slept so long. But I suppose my body just needed the rest!

## Morning

My morning went rather normal despite my sleeping in again. I had my time with God to start the day and then I did my shaving and shower routine. It was a beautiful morning out. So, I proceeded to get a sunrise photo for today's Vitamin G post. Today's came straight out of my time with God this morning. James 1:19-21; which reads, "Know this, my brothers and sisters. Be quick to hear, and slow to speak, slow to anger: for anger does not honor God. So put away all filthiness and wickedness, in humbleness receive the word, which is able to save your souls." This became the Vitamin G, "I need to listen to understand. If Iâ€™m listening to react or respond, I might do so in anger or misunderstanding. If I remove my own bias from my thoughts, I can better and humbly comprehend the concerns of others."

After all of that, I began work. Again, I cannot really talk about what I do. As a Lead Software Engineer, I am almost always working on a contract with a non-disclosure agreement or work for publicly traded companies. And unless you are also a software engineer at some level, nothing generic I would say about my work would honestly make much sense. But I will say that today was a very productive day.

## Another personal best

After my trip to Indiana for Christmas, I hadn't really gotten back into my exercise routine. I'm slowing getting back into the swing of things. It doesn't help that I'm having trouble with my sleep schedule this week. Fortunately, I was able to get in a jog at lunchtime today. The weather was perfect for a run today. The sun was shining and the temperature was in the high 50s. With the sun shining brightly, 50s feels fantastic while running.

For this run, I wore my runDisney 5K shirt I received as part of my registration for last year's Wine & Dine 5K event I participated in. It is long sleeve and perfect for a day like today. With this being my first official jog for the year, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from my body. It had been 3 weeks since my last real jog. And it just so happened that 3 weeks prior I had hit my personal best 5K time. So today, I wasn't really expecting much.

After the first 2 miles of the 3.1 miles in my 5K attempt, I was beginning to feel like I needed to just walk that last mile. I walked for a quarter of that third mile and felt like I might be able to finish the rest with running. So I kicked it back up to a jog pace. While running that last part, I kept thinking that God will carry me through. If I actually needed to stop, I was certain He would prompt me to do so through His Spirit. Guess what!?! I finished that 3.1 miles (5K) with a new personal best!!! Whaaat?!? YESSS!!!

## Next steps

This is just the beginning of this year's 21 days of prayer and fasting. I'm already getting some ideas of what God plans for me this year. For example, I've been writing in this blog every day this week. This is giving me the momentum to get back into writing my first book. And as I could see in today's run, I have a strong feeling this year's health journey is going to be another celebration! Stay tuned!!!
