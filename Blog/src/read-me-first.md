# Read Me First

## Welcome

If this is your first visit to my online journal (blog), welcome! If you have been here before and this is your first time reading this entry or you are reading it again, welcome back! The purpose of this entry is introduce you to what this site is and hopefully add some clarity to it's true purpose.

## Behind the Curtain

I can be viewed as a thinker. And in many ways, I am actually an over thinker...hehehe (Side note, you'll see me say *hehehe*, *HAHAHA*, or *LOL* quite a bit in this journal...I literally make those sounds or expressions in real life. So I make it a part of my writer's voice here as well.) I naturally have a curious mind. I attempt to analyze most things to better understand my world. I'm quite often trying to figure things out. Beginning in 2024, I wanted to document the seemingly randomness of what I think about and how I think about most things. *So, I was thinking...* is a look *behind the curtain of a curious mind*. My mind. The thoughts and feelings written on these pages are mine, and mine alone.

Depending on how much you read through my journal, you may come across contradictory concepts or statements. That's okay. This can be considered a living site. Each time I write, I'm expressing my thoughts and feelings in the moment. I could write about the same topic multiple times and have new insight each time. Something I think or feel today may in fact be so different than how I thought or felt in the past that what I say *today* can be the complete opposite of what I said *yesterday*. I am human. I am growing. I am *a work in progress...making progress*.

## A Work in Progress

I sometimes refer to my life in terms of software releases. In that case, there have been about 7 or 8 different versions of the software known as *Greg*...hehehe Each version of myself has been built on top of a previous version. From time to time, I'll start from *scratch*. But not really. Even when I do a *reset* on my *source code*, I'm still building new versions of myself on top of the concepts that formed who I am up to that point.

But I suppose the point I'm trying to make is, I'm not finished yet. God has been working in and through my life, my entire life. That will never stop. I am evolving into the person God wants me to be. Who I am *today* is not who I will be *tomorrow*. So I encourage you to read my journal from that point of view. I would encourage you to not challenge what I say when I say it. Rather, be just as curious as I am and ask questions for clarification. That's what I'm doing as I write. I'm being *curious, not judgemental*.

## Making Progress

Sometimes it feels as thought I'm living a *one step forward, two steps back* momentum. I deal with setbacks just like anyone else. One day, I may seem super positive in something I've written. The next day, I could be incredibly hard on myself and go down a darker path. As I'll state many times, that's okay!

The thing I'm focusing on, and I hope you do as well, is the fact that I am making progress in this life. Although I'll sometimes refer to past pain or trauma, be rest assured that I am not stuck in my past.
