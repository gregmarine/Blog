Happy Stitch Day! Hehehe Today is one of those made up Disney holidays...LOL Stitch is experiment 626 in the *Lilo & Stitch* franchise. So June 26th (6/26) became Stitch Day...HAHAHA He's one of Malachi's favorite characters. I think my nephews also have him as a favorite. And, my sister-in-law's birthday is today...hehehe Happy Birthday to her!

I use to have a business making Disney-inspired stuff using my 3D modeling and printing skills. If I ever do that again, I'll need to be sure to keep a calendar of all the Disney-inspired *holidays* and events to get people excited about my products...LOL Some of my favorite things I made back then were from *Lilo & Stitch*. I especially loved the hibiscus Mickey/Minnie ears I created...hehehe

Realizing I’m exactly where I am meant to be and I have exactly what I’m meant to have in this exact moment is a very freeing feeling. Finding contentment truly has been a blessing. I still don't feel this way 100% of the time. But it has been this way more often than not lately. It's is one of those things I really hope is becoming a lifestyle and not just a season.

With contentment being a daily, and often moment to moment choice, I think all I need to do is develop mindful habits to remind myself to remain grateful. I've recently had a few reminders that my circumstances aren't really what I want all of the time. But I keep reminding myself that I can still choose to be joyful about everything. When I start to see what I don't have that I desire, I can refocus and see what I do have is still quite amazing.

I've tried hard not to ask God for things I desire lately. I'm not sure that is the right approach. It does seem to keep me humble. Yet, is it something I should be avoiding? I suppose it depends on the motives. I think the reason I'm avoiding it now is because there were so many times I'd ask for a desire and the answer would be *no* or *not yet*. I need to be okay with those answers. I need to drop my fear of rejection, don't I? God wants me to tell Him what I want, doesn't He?

When I consider that He so often provides better things for me than even what I desire, perhaps I just need to learn to ask for the better desires. Perhaps I should be asking Him to help me with my desires? I think the next evolution of my choosing joy each day is to begin to figure out how to also choose better desires and wants. Going beyond being okay with *no* or *not yet* and start desiring what I have in the moment.

I found out that the colleague I mentioned the other day is getting extended through the end of July now. Just 2 days ago, he was looking at this being his last week with the company. Now, he's going to be around for another month...LOL I am reminded today that the only constant in life is change...hehehe I'm happy to get to continue working with him for another month. And I hope this change in status is a good thing for him.
