# TBD

This has been a much better week than last week. When I am able to identify a possible reason for my emotions, I'm able to better understand them and figure out how to course correct. The same is true for when I am able to identify my personality treats, passions, and abilities. But then I struggle with how to balance it all...hehehe

Balance has been a theme and key component for my life. When things are out of balance, I start to wobble and fall over. When things are in balance, I can remain stable and upright. I wonder how I can begin to identify when things are about to go out of balance so I can prevent my life from becoming unbalanced?..hmmm

Sometimes I do wish that I wasn't such a thinker all of the time. Yeah, wishing I was not something that I am isn't the healthiest of thoughts...LOL I believe it is very human to want to be something other than we are. I don't know if everyone goes through this or not. But I definitely do. I'm not always content with who I am. I can be content with my circumstances and still feel like I'm not who I want to be.

When people laugh at my jokes or tell me they love my humor, I want to be a comedian. When people tell me they enjoy my singing, I want to be a performer. When people tell me they love my art, I want to be a painter. And when people love what I say and write, I want to be a writer. Truth is, I'm all those things and more. Yet, none of them are my passion.
