# TBD

It has been a really long day...hehehe With the exception of a quick nap today, I've been up for nearly 24 hours now. By the time I go to sleep tonight, I'll have been up for at least 24 hours...hehehe Half of that time was my traveling to California, though. I took the nap so I could make it through church tonight...LOL

The travel stuff is pretty boring. So I won't go into details. Both flights were smooth and on schedule. So nothing out of the ordinary to talk about there. Picking up my rental car was very smooth. The car has Apple CarPlay in it. So I'm able to be hands-free and navigate as easily as I do with my own car back home. I was able to check into my hotel early. So even that was super smooth. All around, it was a fantastic day to travel and was a pleasant experience. To entertain myself, I watched both of the recent *Dune* movies. They are *okay* for what they are. They aren't likely movies I'll watch again unless they make a third movie. It felt like they left it open for a third.

After I settled into my hotel, I was pretty hungry. I had a few snacks on the flights and at the airport in Las Vegas. But I hadn't had a real meal all day...hehehe
