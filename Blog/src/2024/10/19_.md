# TBD

When I was about 17 years old, I found myself in Branson, Missouri, performing music from the musical Oklahoma. Back in those days, I was in a show choir and performed in places like Branson and Disney World. I look fondly on those years. But I also must admit I did not enjoy all of it in the moment...LOL Performing on stage was fun. But I was actually just following in my brother's footsteps. Being on stage was a part of who he was. Not who I was...hehehe

The parts of that season on my life that I loved including supporting and watching others perform. I always sat with the parents from all the other schools. All the while, my *friends* would be roaming the places we were visiting just being kids. I couldn't really relate to people my own age. Actually, I still can't...LOL Most of my friends today are either my parents age and older, or young enough to be my kids. I do have a few friends in their 30s. But I know very few people in their 40s...LOL I'm talking about folks I know in person. Online, I know people my own age, along with all the others.

On that trip to Branson, we found ourselves at Silver Dollar City. It's an amusement park in the Ozark Mountains. It was fun...hehehe Kids being kids, the people I was with that day weren't being friendly to one of the other kids. There was one of my classmates that no body liked. Honestly, I didn't like him either. But I'm a friend to everyone. Well, all but he ended up on a rollercoaster with him being on the ride after the rest of us. After we got off the ride ourselves, they all started to dart to ditch this other guy. I refused to do so. I told my *friends* that I was going to wait for him. I couldn't bear the thought of someone doing that to me. So, I remained. Some of those other kids respected my choice and decided to stop running and they came back. The kid no one else liked, to this day, has no idea that he was going to be ditched that day.

Well, guess how many of those *friends*, including that kid who was almost ditched, are still in my life?!? Yep, not a single one of them...LOL I have no idea where any of them are today...except one. But the memory of that day is etched in the walls of my heart. I'm not quite sure why I thought about it today. I suppose it could be that I woke up today being grateful that I have another day to make the most of my life. It was moments like that one that defined who God created me to be. He created me to love. Not love as the world loves. But love as He loves. They say kindness costs nothing. I disagree. Kindness, and all fruit of the spirit, costs me all that I am as a human. I have to deny myself, take up my cross, and following Jesus. I'm glad I did just that on that day. I would have loved to fit in with the rest of the crowd from my selfish side. But God gave me a heart to think about how my actions impact others.

Overthinking turned off
