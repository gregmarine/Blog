## 3 Hole Gutter

Gutters are designed to direct the overflow of rain water away and through a channel to a place where it can flow freely and as to not cause damage to a structure. I often see such a gutter when I look outside from my patio. There is this 3 hole gutter outlet near the top of a wall on the nearby mall adjacent to my apartment complex.

I imagine the most important purpose to those gutter holes I see is to keep the roof of the mall from collecting too much water and thus causing the roof to collapse. These 3 holes likely serve a great purpose to avoid the possibility for a great amount of damage to occur to the overall structure of the mall's building.

The roots of a plant are designed quite differently than gutters. Roots will absorb water and help provide nourishment to the plant. Water helps to transfer important nutrients in the soil into a plant through the root system that also helps keep the plant upright in the soil in which it is rooted.

Unlike a gutter, roots are eloquently purposed with stopping the flow of water away and instead directs water directly into the path of what a plant needs to grow and sustain its existence on the earth. Even after a tree falls or is cut down, the roots often remain in the ground as a reminder of what their purpose is. And sometimes the roots will appear outside of the soil as if it is waving to say hello...hehehe

When I first started shaving my head in early 2020, one of the first things I noticed is that rain no longer bothered me. When I allowed my hair to grow, I hated to be in the rain as my hair would get wet and the water would pour down my face. It was so annoying!

Now, when it rains on my head, the water seems to bounce off or take a path down my head other than on my face. I love being able to walk through the rain without it bothering me anymore. I see people huddled under umbrellas or ponchos or running through the rain trying to avoid getting too wet.

Regardless where I stand on my feelings toward rain, it has its purpose in life. Life needs water! All living things need it in some capacity. Sure, it's nice to get needed water from a faucet or a bottle. But the natural world needs the flow of water from the sky and through waterways such as rivers and streams.

Anything created by humans seems to need to control the water that flows in, around, or over it. The idea that water can destroy something a human has built becomes evident when it rains so much that a flood occurs. Hence the purpose of a gutter. But what about all that God has made?!?

God created me. He knows every part of me. He knows when I need the rain and when I need the sunshine. He also knows when I need both. There are no gutters around me to protect me from what I think the rain is doing to me. Instead, He is growing roots within my soul to help me absorb the nutrients my soul needs when it does rain in my life. Although I was speaking literally previously, I am of course speaking figuratively now.

Last week, I received the news that my company was outsourcing the work I am currently doing. This not only affects me, but most of my colleagues that I've worked with these past 4 years. I honestly felt I would serve out the remaining years of my career with this company. Yet, here I am looking at the final months of my time with the company already.

I know God is teaching me a valuable lesson during this season of my life and career. He has always provided regardless of my circumstances. And this will be no different. He isn't going to use a gutter system to divert the troubling waters around my soul this time. He is going to allow the roots He is has formed in my soul to absorb some valuable lessons here. What those lessons are remains to be seen. However, I feel so strongly rooted that I know I will overcome yet another season of change in this life.

Back to the literal, I was rained on yesterday. There was a light drizzle on my way to church. During the service, you could hear it clearly pouring down as the rain hit the roof of the building. Although not as hard as during the service, it was still raining when I got out of church. As I mentioned above, the rain just bounced off my bald head and never covered my face. I'm fortunately in that regard.

We needed the rain in here my area. The ground has been getting pretty dry lately. And I need the rain that comes through my circumstances. My spirit needs some nourishment to keep growing! I'm grateful for the 3 hole gutter I see across the way from my apartment. It is a nice reminder why God didn't make gutters around my soul. But rather roots to help my soul absorb the Living Water.
