# TBD

It is well with my soul. I don't really want to describe what happened last night. But something interesting did happened. And a calmness and peace flooded my soul beyond any I have experienced before; as a result of what happened. I would love to always feel that way...hehehe Alas, that isn't how life works...LOL I could go into great detail about what it is I saw/experienced and how I responded to it. But I feel as though it was a moment for just my memory. I am only bringing it up in my journal to hopefully be a reminder someday that, although the sword may cut through the back of expectation, I should remain with Him always without any doubts about His Love. And I should always be grateful for what I receive from those I care most for. They may not always be with me. But cherishing who they are now, and then the memories we share after they're gone, is so important. And I should never expect more than what I receive. I'm not meant to have everything I think I want. *With an attitude of gratitude, let's accept what is meant for us today. And reject what isn't!* (Today's Vitamin G)

I don't know what it is, why it is, or if anyone else experiences this...but I often draw connections in my mind between stories I watch or read with the personal experiences I have with people I have a relationship with. It's kinda fun to see us playing a role in some epic story. I suppose some of the characters I see or read about remind me of someone important in my life. So it is as if I'm watching their life unfold in some fantastical or romantic fashion. I then place myself in the role of the sidekick...hehehe Likewise, I am reminded of myself in some characters. I play the lead role and I mentally invite friends and family to play the parts of the supporting characters in my own narrative. It probably sounds silly. But I do have that silly side of me. So, I love it!

So, I've evolved my routine and schedule a bit more...hehehe

I was taken off the new project...LOL
