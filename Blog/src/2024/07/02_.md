# TBD

I'm not sure how much I'll put in today's journal entry. But I wanted to write something today. I have a few things that are relevant for today...hehehe But I'm also about to go on a trip and wanted to kick that off in today's journal. I hope to journal each evening on the trip to catalog what I did that day and what I thought about. Part of the point of this trip is to get out of my own head and sort of do a reset to kick off the second half of this calendar year. It will also be a reflection on the first quarter of my personal year.

Today is dad's birthday! Happy Birthday Dad!!! He turns 70 today. He was born in California near the area I'm traveling to. It is somewhat serendipitous that it worked out that I'd be traveling there just after his 70th birthday...hehehe I've been in his life for the last 46 years. So he would have been 23 the day I was born and turned 24 3 months later. He was so young and probably didn't know what he was doing...LOL j/k He's doing pretty well overall. I imagine he'll be around for quite sometime to come; Lord Willing, of course.

My late cousin's birthday is on the 4th. My aunt and uncle have a hard time with that still. He passed away a few years ago from some sort of heart event. I don't recall if it was a heart attack, heart disease, or what it was. But it had something to do with his heart. They have a rough time on most holidays. But especially this one because it was his birthday. I try to encourage them through it all. It's so difficult. They've adopted me as sort of a son after his death. I'll definitely reach out to them that day. But I'll be praying for strength. I am not their son. I can't hold the weight of that burden on my heart. Not that they lie it on me. It's just that I have empathy for their circumstance.
