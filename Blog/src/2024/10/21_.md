# TBD

## 07:45am

I've been struggling with my writing. Once again, I've written quite a bit. All unpublished. I never seem to finish my thoughts. And my routine has been a bit chaotic lately. It has been over four weeks now since I've felt like my days have been normal...LOL I honestly don't feel like this week will be any different. I'm considering trying a new routine altogether since I can't seem to get back into what was working a month ago...hehehe

I just finished reading Cherie's latest journal entry and watching her video from this past weekend. It looked like she had such a lovely day in LA. That makes my heart so happy. There were a few familiar things in the video from our day in July...hehehe I'm so glad she was able to experience the rose garden on her own. It was one of the places we talked about going to had I been able to go in September. But her being able to experience it on her own for the first time this past Saturday makes my heart so happy <3 In a way, I was still there. She sent me a little video and a photo from there. So I was there in spirit...hehehe

My day has started off quite different than most days. My prayer time to start the day was completely different than anything I've ever experienced since I started doing it over a year ago. This time, I woke up praying. It was like I had been dreaming it and then was doing it in real life. But I wasn't speaking the words aloud. It was just in my heart. I'm unaware of how long I was praying. So many things came to my heart and I prayed about them all. I have no idea if this will happen again. I typically make the prayer the first conscious thing I do for the day. In this case, it began from an unconscious state and transitioned into the conscious. So, not exactly something I can plan...LOL I've had similar experiences before. However, those were in the middle of the night and not when I was waking for the day.

I have a bit of a healthy anxiety about what is coming next for my life. It's an excitement with a little bit of fear of the unknown. There is Soul Construction Ahead...Proceed with Prayer.
