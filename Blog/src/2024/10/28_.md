Good morning! Happy Monday!!!

I'm really excited for this week! I expect productivity at work to continue. And I'll be spending part of the week preparing for my California trip! Next Monday through Thursday, I'll be working from the little apartment I'm renting. But Sunday and Friday I'll be at Disneyland!!! The following Saturday will be a day of rest before I travel back home that Sunday. I also have the day off on November 11th for Veteran's Day. I'm not sure what I'll do that day just yet...hehehe

I didn't journal yesterday. I had a really good momentum going last week. But yesterday, I didn't get around to doing it. Throughout the day, my path didn't bring me to the keyboard to write here. And by the time I settled in the evening, I decided I didn't want to sit at the computer. When I woke this morning, I just felt like going back to it...hehehe

I did not end up having lunch with Valerie yesterday. As I've stated before, I'm grateful for the brief time our journey's crossed. I had hoped a friendship would happen. I hope I added to her life the times we took those walks. I know she added to mine through her stories. And I've been praying for her. So, taking thoughts of her to the Lord has been a blessing.

It was strange that I wasn't disappointed in not having lunch with her yesterday. I extended the invitation on Tuesday and she seemed quite excited about it. She even suggested we have a seafood meal at a seaside restaurant. It was to be a farewell meal as she is moving next week. But on Wednesday, she wanted to change it to having a pizza at the pool...hehehe By the time our walk was over that day, it became more of a *we'll see how she feels on Sunday*. When it didn't happen yesterday, I was already prepared. I had set my expectations with her on Tuesday, and she decided not to accept those expectations by Wednesday...hehehe The growth I've experienced this year enabled me to realize that it's okay when things do not work out quite like we expect or hope. But with the right heart posture, things work out better than we expect or hope for. God is always working out things for our good and for His Glory. And I have peace about things not working out for our friendship.
