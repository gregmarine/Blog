# TBD

In my haste to finish my journal entry yesterday and try to spend my evening relaxing and recovering, I completely failed to mention that yesterday was a significant day in my journey...hehehe It was the anniversary of the day I met my son's mother! 24 years ago, I was doing a live album recording for one of my brother's college day bands. She was attending that concert on her last day of college classes as she was about to graduate. She and my brother knew each other through one of the campus ministries at the college they both attended.

My brother was well known for his adventurous road trips he had thrown together over the course of his college career. He later inspired me to throw together some amazing road trips myself that I would often do while I was working the music production for his bands. As he was no longer actually in college, he had pretty much passed on the road trip king crown to me.

 She had never actually been on one of these road trips. So she approached my brother that night and asked if he would throw one together for her since it was her last day of classes. He called me over and introduced me to her and asked if I would design a road trip just for her. I was happy to do so and quite honored that he would consider me for the task for such a special trip.
