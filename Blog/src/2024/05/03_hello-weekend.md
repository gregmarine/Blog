# Hello Weekend

I woke up today thinking I’d try to do a timestamp journal. As you can see, I did not do that…hehehe Maybe tomorrow?! LOL The reason I’d like to do that again is it helps me jot down my thoughts as I have them instead of batching them up into spurts of thoughts hours in the making. The problem I see with batching up my thoughts is that sometimes I lose what I was thinking about in the moment. It isn’t that the thought is completely gone. But sometimes I lose some of the essence of what I was wanting to write. By taking the timestamp approach, I’ll be in the practice of writing my thoughts as I have them. I can then later refine them if they are something I want to turn into a more formal writing in the future. Writing as I go through my day will help retain more of what I was thinking in the moment.

At the moment, I’m sitting at Zen Kitchen & Bar. This is the place that inspired me to look for the app I’m using to write this journal entry. Although my signal seems stable today, I’m still glad I have this app to write with in case the signal gets spotty again. It was so frustrating writing when my connection would drop. The way I’ve always written was through a *web app* that requires a stable connection to the Internet. I don’t really know why it works this way, but it basically sent every keystroke to a server. As I made mistakes and needed to backspace or delete words, it could take several seconds for the app to catch up to my typing speed…hehehe And in some cases, it would timeout and miss what I was typing. Yeah, frustrating for sure…LOL

It has been awhile since this has happened, but I have no plans for the weekend. Yay!!! It’s a blank canvas…hehehe Whatever shall I do?!? I’m thinking about getting out on the water tomorrow morning. I’m not sure yet if I’ll do that. But I am at least considering it. It should be warm enough. The weather otherwise seems favorable as well. If I do, I’ll take my paddle board on its maiden voyage…hehehe I’ve had it since Christmas and haven’t yet taken her out…LOL Could tomorrow be the day? We shall see. It would actually be a little poetic to do so tomorrow. It is the 2 year anniversary of my official residency in Florida. I came down a few weeks before that. But my move in date was May 4, 2022.

The weather is finally feeling like Florida again. Yesterday was the first day I wore shorts at home in quite a while. I’ve worn them at Disney a few times. But I’ve mostly been in pants for the last 6 months…hehehe I find it so weird that my body has acclimated to the climate so quickly. Then again, my body has gone through a major transformation since January last year. Feeling cold most of the time is my nature now, I guess…LOL I see folks around here wearing normal Florida clothing. It seems as though it is just me that was still in *Florida winter* clothes.

Zen ran out of non-alcoholic beer…hehehe Since I’ve been coming so much, I guess I drank them out of it…LOL I guess it’s just water for me until they restock. I may get a mocktail or two if I feel like it. The good thing is I’m not tempted to go back to alcohol. I’m sticking with my abstinence. My body has been grateful that I haven’t had any alcohol in a while. I’d like to stick with that. Feeling good is important. My body is a temple of God’s Holy Spirit. I’ve been on this journey for about 16 months now. Taking care of this temple has become a lifestyle. *Let’s keep going, Greg*!

Okay, so far, I’ve written all of this from Zen Kitchen & Bar using the new app. This experience is so much better…hehehe

I may work on some paintings this weekend. I have a project in mind that will actually be sort of a symbol of my healing. I’m not going to drag us down into the muddy details, but *The Nightmare Before Christmas* has been a trigger for a little bit. It no longer is and that’s a good sign of healing. Letting going of my attachments of negative emotions to certain things (like a movie in this case) is definitely working. That movie had some negative attachments to some of the trauma I’ve experienced. God’s deliverance from that trauma is allowing me to enjoy that movie again. To anyone who has never experienced trauma, they just wouldn’t understand how a movie could trigger someone. Yet, there it is…LOL I have a mini painting or two in mind to create from that movie. It may actually turn into a series of paintings. The artistry of the movie in general is amazing. To capture it in my own works should be fun! And, again, proof to myself that I have been delivered from the trauma I once experienced. Goodbye pain, hello forgiveness! Yay!!!

Well, it’s time to leave Zen…LOL I’ll continue writing after bit…hehehe

I didn’t really get back to writing tonight…hehehe But I’ve had a pleasant evening. To summarize the rest of the day, I finished the work week strong, did today’s devotion for *The Chosen*, made a delicious omelette for dinner, and I made popping corn using ghee for the cooking oil for the first time.

I’m strongly considering getting out on the water in the morning. Hopefully I’ll include that experience in tomorrow’s journal entry. Is that enough pressure to get me to go out?..LOL

Ooh, I had an idea tonight for a retro movie/TV show about Jesus’ life. It’s spaghetti western meets film noir meets period piece. All black and white, out in the desert in America’s Wild West, and Jesus is narrating between scenes about what He’s thinking…hehehe

The strum of a lonely guitar…a tumbleweed rolls by…a foot in a sandal steps into frame…camera pans up to see a bearded face with the sun glaring from beside his left cheek…

Jesus thinks to Himself, “These people…they’re like little children. Hungry to hear more. Hungry for love. Hungry for hope. They are broken. But I’m here now…”

Jesus steps up on a boulder, stretches out his arms, and says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

Title frame appears… *How The World Was Saved*

Fade to black…
