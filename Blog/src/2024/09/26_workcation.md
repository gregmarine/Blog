# Workcation

Another journal entry when the title came before writing...LOL I'm on a workcation...hehehe It isn't quite a vacation. It isn't quite a staycation. And it definitely isn't a naycation. I'm working from Disney World while also enjoying the amenities of the vacation capital of the world...hehehe

The room's coffee maker makes horrible coffee. So I made a quick trip to the food court to get a decent cup of coffee. I found a window of opportunity between rain showers. The impact of the storm is upon us here. It hasn't been bad yet. I actually don't know that it will ever get too bad here in central Florida. At least out of the ordinary for this area in this season of the year. The hurricane remains out in the gulf. The eye of the storm will not be passing over Disney World.

My workload is actually pretty light right now. Other people on my team seem to have heavier workloads than I do. However, they aren't the sort of tasks that can be shared with the likes of me. So, I'll just stick to my tasks and do my best not to worry about how others are doing on my team.

It's raining pretty heavy at the moment (9:45am). But the wind isn't bad. So, it seems like the typical rain shower for here. That said, it is definitely one of the bands of rain from the hurricane. I love watching the rain. I have the curtain opened to watch it...hehehe Unfortunately, people keep walking by and looking in...LOL When I walk by a hotel room's window, I look straight ahead. I don't want to look inside rooms...LOL

The hurricane is a category 2 now. The current predictions are now showing that it will be a 3 before landfall. Last night, it was looking like it might become a category 4 by then. Regardless, where it makes landfall will get devastated. My heart aches for those folks. Even if they get out of the way of the storm, they'll be going home to a disaster. The wind has picked up by a lot here now (9:55am). They storms are amazingly and beautifully dangerous. They must be respected.

I love Florida. Most of the time, there isn't anything to be concerned about. Storms pop up during this season. And on occasion there are these massive hurricanes. But for the most part, it is a lovely place to live. That said, I do question myself during these storms...LOL

The rain and wind are letting up now (10:00am). As you can see by the timestamps I included, a lot can change in 15 minutes...LOL

I'm hoping to be able to make it to one of the parks for lunch today. There should be a break in the weather long enough for me to do so. I think it'll be fun to take advantage of where I am. It'll be an experience I'll not forget. I might as well enjoy it for what it is while I'm living it...hehehe
