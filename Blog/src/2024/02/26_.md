## First Shop Visit

On Saturday, I took my car in for its first shop visit since I purchased it last September. It was well overdue for a checkup as I've already put on about 6-10k miles on it. 2 of those thousand were for my trip back to Indiana back in December...hehehe I probably should have take it in before that trip. I think I had already put on 5k by then. I drive a lot more than I thought I would!

Having a car is a necessary evil where I live. Nothing of importance is anywhere near me. I originally moved to my current location because my sister and her husband lived nearby. After they divorced, he moved away and excommunicated me and my sister moved about 45 minutes south of me. Nothing else I enjoy is anywhere near. I even have a 20-25 minute drive just to get to church. I've thought about moving closer to the church. But that is still at least another year away.

The initial assessment was that the car is still in fantastic condition. They only recommended the usual stuff based on the mileage of the car. I went ahead and agreed to all of it so those things would be good for another 30k miles. It was a bit more expensive that I would have liked. But then again, it was all maintenance that will prevent other issues that would cost a lot more. I have experience in lettings cars without necessary maintenance and that has cost me far more than I'd care to admit...hehehe

Back to this being a necessary evil, I often wonder what it would be like to live in an apartment that is within walking distance of everything important. I've even looked into places in the few cities I wouldn't mind living in that are close to the grocery and some social places I think I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, Florida isn't train friendly. The few places where a train can take me to places like Disney aren't the sort of cities I would want to live in. There is talk about a train line coming between Tampa and Orlando. But that isn't set in stone yet.

That said, I'm not really a city boy. My heart belongs to the countryside. I even owned a home out in the middle of nowhere once. I miss that lifestyle. If I stay in Florida, it would be nice to purchase some acreage and put a simple house where I can grow some of my own food and have a garden would be great. But it probably won't happen. So I need to find the least objectionable living space...LOL I just don't think it will ever be a space where I won't need a car...HAHAHA

One of the benefits of that trip to the shop was that I was able to work about 3 hours on my book. When the service manager asked me what I was up to, I mentioned I was working on a book. Although his initial interest in what I was doing was likely just surface level, he seemed a bit surprised at my response. So, he inquired more about the project. It was a pleasant conversation which led to talking about how he has been working on overcoming some issues from his own past. WOW! He hasn't even read my book and it has already gotten him to think about all that he has already overcome. That's pretty awesome!

## Tarpon Springs

After that time at the shop, and a quick bathroom break at home, I decided to make what I thought would be a quick trip to Tarpon Springs. I had thought about going the night before. But I ended up just getting a frozen pizza and watched the Dodgers game...hehehe There is
