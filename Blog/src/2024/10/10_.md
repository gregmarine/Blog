# TBD

I have seemingly contradictory feelings today...LOL It's like a splendid misery of sorts. I have a heavy heart. Yet, my heart is also full of joy. How would I, *Greg Marine*, best put into words how I feel today? Let's go on a journey today, shall we?! I'll do my best to write out what I'm thinking and how I feel. I have no expectations of finding any conclusions today. All I truly expect from writing today is to continue growing as a person. We shall see what that looks like at the end of the day...hehehe

One thing bringing me joy today is I remained safe throughout the storm and was able to feel safe in my home. I did not need to evacuate. Technically, there was a *mandatory* evacuation order for my zone. But two things factored into my decision to remain at home.

The first, and foremost, was I felt God telling me to trust Him. On the surface, I imagine that looks or sounds like I was testing God. Nope, I was trusting. I had absolutely no logical reason to stay at home. I know that by staying home there wasn't anything I could do to *protect* my *stuff* from a hurricane had it hit here directly. As I've expressed many times with folks lately, my *stuff* just doesn't have value to me anymore. I genuinely felt an actual calling to stay put. If this were a test of any kind, it would be more of a test of my own faith. A *Peter walking on water* sort of test. But I want to make it abundantly clear. I did not stay for the sake of any kind of test. I simply obeyed a calling. Nothing more...nothing less. I cannot say that it makes any sense. So, if you are confused, I'm right there with you! Regardless, I had an abundance of peace about staying home. And God gave me the opportunity to pour out that peace on some of my neighbors who remained home as well. They would have stayed whether I did or not. Sharing my peace with them was a blessing for us all.

The second factor into my decision were the facts of this storm. I follow the *MyRadar* folks. They present facts and do their best to educate their users and viewers on how these storms actually work. They do stress the importance of evacuating when there is such an order to do so. Yes, I ignored that order even after their advice not to...LOL However, I studied the facts about what was making up this storm. All of the weather phenomena clearly showed this storm would make landfall quite a ways south of me. That said, *quite a ways* to me is subjective. Someone looking at a map would say it was actually pretty close...LOL Being down on the ground, I know it really wasn't that close. And the wind and rain we experienced in my area weren't anything more than a regular storm. But it was actually less in a way...there wasn't even any lightning.

Okay, now that I've listed my two main reasons for staying put, I want to connect them. The second factor is pretty weak. I'm going to state the obvious, there is always a risk. As much information as we have about hurricanes these days, there are still so many unknowns. In fact, there were unique phenomena about this one that they'll be studying this storm for a while learning all new things about hurricanes. So, as weak as my argument is about the *facts*, I return to the calling I feel about trusting God. I truly believe He wanted me to stay. And in doing so, He used me to bring peace to those who were going to stay anyway. As much as I question myself, I do not question that. I had a purpose...His purpose. The fruit of that is as clear to see as a grape growing on a vine.
