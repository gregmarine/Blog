# TBD

Happy Wednesday and welcome to another entry in the journal telling my story...hehehe If you came today looking for the next, and probably final, installment about my trip to North Carolina, I'm terribly sorry to disappoint. Today feels like another general journaling kind of day.

Well, I do suppose there is one NC trip note I can make today. I'm dealing with allergies today...LOL While I was up there last week, I decided I would use my allergy medication seeing as I was in a different region of the continent and all...hehehe Upon my return home, I ceased the medication and resumed my daily local honey routine. I felt the allergies impacting me late last night and I've been dealing with it all day today. I do wonder if it might be a delayed reaction from my trip? Or...have I not actually been cured of dealing with Florida allergies? I'll keep monitoring the situation...

Now back to our regularly scheduled journal entry...hehehe

Last week, I [talked about being tired](./19_more-continued#im-tired). I won't rehash all of that because you can simply click and have a read of what I previously said...hehehe But I did want to give a quick update on all of that. I found the rest I needed. More on that in a moment. One of the more obvious signs I am back to my usual self is how I have posted *Vitamin G* these past three days. I had compiled a list of things I wanted to post but wasn't quite ready to yet. Well, I've been able to go through that list this week. It isn't that I was scheduling these things or setting up a batch. I just wrote down things I would normally post but didn't feel like posting when they came to mind. I truly was tired and didn't want to toss those things out into the world without being able to engage should someone find them inspiring.

I take great care in what I say because words are important. And actions need to match the words, as they are equally important. I decided long ago I would only post something when I was prepared for a conversation. I seldom get someone engaging in a conversation. That is absolutely okay. I just feel that to remain truly genuine to who I am, I can't just say something and not be ready to talk about it...hehehe

I also finally got around to posting the [painting](./06_thought-playground#painting-contest) I made for the contest at work earlier this month. That post received a great response. Especially on Twitter! On Twitter, I received some positive feedback. I also received some feedback on Threads and Instagram. I'm so grateful for the feedback and I'm so glad I posted it. Although I didn't do well in the contest itself, the painting needed to exist. Now that it is public, I can see why. Some of the folks thanked me for posting it and how they were inspired by it.
