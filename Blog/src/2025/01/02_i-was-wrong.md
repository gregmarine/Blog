# I Was Wrong

I sure am tired today...LOL It is weird how much more worn out I am today than I was yesterday. The night before was New Year's when I stayed up late and got poor sleep into yesterday. I was tire, sure. But I made it through the day. Today, after 7 and half hours of sleep, I have been dragging all day long...LOL

I suppose part of this isn't physical. I'm also emotionally and mental exhausted. I have those times when I need to rest my entire being. Perhaps that time is coming again. November and December were amazing. A lot happened. I think maybe it is catching up with me. But then again, I faced something similar going into those months if I recall correctly. I haven't gone back to my journal to see exactly when it happened last. But it doesn't feel like it was that long ago...hehehe

These are just thoughts right now, though. I'm not the least bit concerned about it. I don't have a lot going on this month. So I'll find plenty of rest. These are just words and those are just feelings. God always helps me find the balance <3

There are some 3 word sentences that are very impactful. *I love you*, *I am sorry*, *I am here*, *I don't know*, and *I was wrong*. The last one, *I was wrong*, is on my mind today. I've been around long enough to have been wrong about a great many things...LOL Admitting it isn't always easy. But it is very freeing.

There isn't anything particular on my mind today that I was wrong about. A lot of things float around in my head sometimes. Today is one of those days when I realize I have been wrong quite a bit in my life. In some ways, I feel like I have never been right...about anything...LOL

I wonder how many of us are wrong about certain things and either carry on with ignorance of it or with pride and ignore it? I can think of times in my life when I have been guilty of both. I don't like to be ignorant or prideful. When I find out I'm wrong, I want to do something about it. If it is just knowledge, I'll seek it and the understanding of it to correct my thinking. If it is an action, I want to correct the mistake or make up for it somehow.

This train of thought took me back over 20 years to a Bible study I was leading through my church at the time. One of the questions asked something to the effect of, *How responsible are we to the parts of the Bible we don't understand?* I chuckled at the question because I thought how could we be responsible at all for things we don't understand? Our pastors would go to a different small group each week during that study. The week we had that question was the week they came to my group...LOL

The pastors believed we are responsible for everything in the Bible. The pastors and I had some debate about the whole thing. I can't say that I could completely understand what they were saying. But after the group was finished, several of the group members came up to me concerned about what the pastors said. To this day, I don't know what was right and what was wrong about either side of the debate.

No matter how responsible we are to the things we don't understand about it, we are very responsible for what we say, share, or teach about the Bible. I feel accountable to what I've said about the Bible and what it is teaching me. *My Book* is full of occasions when *I was wrong* about what it says. I've missed the context. I've read it in ways it was never written to be read. And at times I've forgotten it is about God and not about me.

I also feel we are responsible to how we apply it to our lives. How I live my life in response to what I've read is important. Other people are watching how I live out this life. I want to be a light in this world so that others will Glorify God. I don't want to cause someone to stumble because I've misinterpreted the Bible and I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing.

This is all abstract thought today. It takes balance to work all of this out. Focusing on my relationship with God is key to that balance. And it is a *relationship*. It's not a one way street I'm talking about. The Bible is all about God. But my relationship with him is all about us...he and I.

And, of course, I could be completely *wrong* about everything except the relationship part...LOL Admitting when *I am wrong* is the only way I can keep moving forward on the path to understanding. It's a humbling experience and one I must do to remain a good student of Jesus.

This all is one of the many reasons I love to have a daily walk with God. Last year, part of that daily walk was doing a Bible in a year plan. I'm continuing that this year. I think originally it was a task to be able to have read the entire Bible. To clarify, it wasn't that I wanted to be able to *say* I have ready the entire thing...LOL The best way to know God is to read the Word of God.

There are parts I simply do not understand. There are other parts that I thought I understood, but clearly did not. And still other parts that I'm learning new understanding with. Reading the Word has become just as important to me as eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing...hehehe I also like to do some deeper studying as well. You can equate my *daily bread* to that of having breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each thing I do has different ingredients to it. But it all nourishes my soul. The key ingredient is the Bible. All other ingredients must be wholesome as well. Just as I don't always eat ever meal each day, I don't always do my *daily bread* the same way every day. Must overall, it is a consistent balance.

There isn't a right or wrong way to be doing these things for the most part. Each of us needs to find the balance we need to maintain our relationship with God. How that looks for each person could be different. I'd say the only wrong things are not to be in a relationship with God and to be finding *daily bread* from the wrong sources. Having a relationship with God is very important and it really does take a daily walk with him. And just like with the food we eat, the sources we consume God's Word from matter.

I have replaced my mini paintings on the one shelf with a series of ensō paintings I did in late 2021. I feel they best represent how I feel going into this new year. God painted my life in a single stroke from beginning to end. I came from him and I'm going back to him. That's my *circle of life*...hehehe
