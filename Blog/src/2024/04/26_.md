## Be Happy

I am having such the happiest morning :face_holding_back_tears: :face_holding_back_tears: :face_holding_back_tears: When asked to share what was making it such a happy morning, all I could say was it is mostly a state of mind. When I count my blessings, I'm left with no time to count my troubles. With the condition of my heart becoming so much better, my mind is being renewed as well. It is difficult to put into words what I am currently experiencing. So I simply sum it up with happiness. There is certainly more to it than that. But why complicate it?..hehehe Just *BE HAPPY* :slightly_smiling_face:

## Self Help?

I suppose I should write more about how I choose happiness. I could put that into a *book*. Although my writing is likely categorized as *self help*, I'd say it is more about self reflection than helping ones self. I prefer to encourage people to view their circumstances with a retrospective and introspective process. And in doing so, discover that we all need help from outside ourselves. Our best life coach is the source of life, God. And His coaching comes to us through His Word and the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, He uses fellowship with other believers to help us remain on the path He has created for us.

Sure, I need to take care of myself in general. I need to be who I am without others. But I was never meant to travel this journey alone. From the beginning of creation, God has provided humanity with the concept of a help mate. It may have started with a marriage union. However, over time, it has become community. Even when Jesus sent out the twelve, He did so by sending them out two by two.

::: details Matthew 10:1-15 AMP
Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority and power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. [Mark 6:7; Luke 9:1] Now these are the names of the twelve apostles (special messengers, personally chosen representatives): first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; [Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:13-16] Philip and Bartholomew (Nathanael); Thomas and Matthew (Levi) the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (Judas, not Iscariot); Simon the Cananaean (Zealot), and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him. Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them: “Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not go into a city of the Samaritans; but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. Do not take gold, or silver, or [even]copper money in your money belt, or a provision bag for your journey, or even two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker deserves his support. Whatever city or village you enter, ask who in it is worthy [who welcomes you and your message], and stay at his house until you leave [that city]. As you go into the house, give it your greeting [that is, ‘Peace be to this house’]. If [the family living in] the house is worthy [welcoming you and your message], give it your [blessing of] peace [that is, a blessing of well-being and prosperity, the favor of God]. But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace. Whoever does not welcome you, nor listen to your message, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust [of it] off your feet [in contempt, breaking all ties]. [Mark 6:11; Acts 13:51] I assure you and most solemnly say to you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city [since it rejected the Messiah’s messenger].

::: details Mark 6:7-13 AMP
And He called the twelve [disciples] and began to send them out [as His special messengers] two by two, and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits. He told them to take nothing for the journey except a mere walking stick—no bread, no [traveler’s] bag, no money in their belts— but to wear sandals; and [He told them] not to wear two tunics. And He told them, “Wherever you go into a house, stay there until you leave that town. Any place that does not welcome you or listen to you, when you leave there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them [breaking all ties with them because they rejected My message].” [Matt 10:14; Acts 13:51] So they went out and preached that men should repent [that is, think differently, recognize sin, turn away from it, and live changed lives]. And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them.

::: details Luke 9:1-6 AMP
Now Jesus called together the twelve [disciples] and gave them [the right to exercise] power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. Then He sent them out [on a brief journey] to preach the kingdom of God and to perform healing. [Matt 10:5] And He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey [that might encumber you]—neither a walking stick, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city [to go to another]. And as for all those who do not welcome you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet [breaking all ties with them] as a testimony against them [that they rejected My message].” So they began going from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing the sick everywhere.

## Loneliness Update Part 2

Yesterday, I gave a quick loneliness update. As I laid my head to rest last night, I realized it was a tad incomplete. That's okay. My journal is full of incomplete thoughts...hehehe I think I didn't include this because I was thinking that I'd be putting it with all that I want to say about my weekend at Disney. Perhaps I'll just repeat myself when I do finally write about the weekend...LOL

I was in the American pavilion at EPCOT sort of in a holding pattern waiting to meet some Twitter friends at the Regal Eagle BBQ quick service. I didn't really know how long I was going to be waiting. So, I looked for a nice shade spot to get out of the sun. I was all dapper for the day, after all...hehehe Standing in the sun for too long meant I might overheat. We don't want that, now do we...hehehe I noticed a woman sitting by herself at a picnic table that was somewhat in the shade of a tree near the fountain in the middle of the pavilion promenade. I walked over to her and asked if she wouldn't mind if I joined her in the shade for a bit. She invited me to sit down and we had a lovely chat.

I've never really done anything like that before. Part of me believes that it was my being dressed dapper that gave me a boost of confidence. When I do dress up at Disney, I feel like a character in a stage performance as opposed to just being *Greg*. However, I also feel it is this renewed spirit God is working on inside my heart. I had been praying that He would help me feel less lonely in a world full of people. That moment with this random stranger was certainly an answer to the prayer. I haven't a clue if she was lonely in the moment. However, I imagine she was equally blessed by it.

She was there for the weekend as a participant of the runDisney event. She told me how she was about to complete the coast to coast challenge. She had run in a Disneyland event earlier this year and the race she was going to run in the next day was the final race for her to complete the challenge. She was going to be awarded with a special medal for the accomplishment. She also told me about her children and how they were a part of the Disney college program at Disney World. It would seem that Disney is as much, if not more, a part of her DNA as it is mine...hehehe I didn't ask her what her name was and I didn't offer mine either. But on our separate journeys, our paths crossed and we were friends for a moment.

Which reminds me, earlier that day, someone was admiring my dapper attire while I was waiting in line for breakfast. They asked me if I was there with anyone else or by myself. I replied that I was there alone. But then I added that *no, I'm here with 100,000 of my friends and family* and gestured that we were surrounded by people. I have no idea how many people visit Disney World each day. However, it's a pleasant thought that most of the people there are those I can share these moments with. Friends for a moment in a lifetime that can be happy. I just need to hold onto the perspective that I'm never truly alone. It is *my* journey. And everyone I come across along the way is very much a part of it. *A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet*...hehehe

There were several moments over the weekend when I was technically by myself just walking around or waiting in some line. And in those moments, I kept smiling. I felt the Spirit reminding me that I was not alone. Mere weeks before, I was sobbing in pain from extreme sadness. Yet, there I was with happy tears in my eyes knowing that I was actually surrounded. When I let go of my own ideas of what loneliness or togetherness is and what those look and feel like, there was room in my heart for what God defines them as. My feelings are very real and valid. I never question that. I'm simply saying that He has something better in mind for me. Focusing on Jesus makes all the difference in my perspective. As I stated above, when I count my blessings, I'm left with no time to count my troubles...hehehe

## Rejoice Always

Last week, my morning devotional time featured 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 for a few days. It somewhat reminds me of Philippians 4:6-7; which is one of my life verses that I try to apply as much as I can. I'm now adding 1 Thessalonians as it takes me one step further. Not only should I avoid being anxious or worried, and not only should I remain continually thankful, I should rejoice always.

::: details 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 AMP
Rejoice always and delight in your faith; be unceasing and persistent in prayer; in every situation [no matter what the circumstances] be thankful and continually give thanks to God; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.
:::

::: details Philippians 4:6-7 AMP
Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests known to God. And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours]. [John 14:27]

Rejoicing, like happiness, is a choice. A choice I must make in every moment. And just like choosing happiness and contentment, choosing to rejoice does not mean I'm ignoring my troubling circumstances. Rejoicing is my acknowledgment of the trust I have in God. I can rejoice because He is always with me. He is working in and through me even when I cannot see it. I can trust God and rejoice in Him! Doing so tends to fill me with His Joy and Strength.

The common task between both passages is prayer. In any relationship, communication is essential. This is no different with my relationship with God. There is no better way to know the Will of God than to be in consistent and constant communication with Him. This allows me to be in tune with the Spirit. This further motivates me to remain in His Word. I don't always understand what I'm praying for and what I'm reading in the Bible. However, He is guiding me through the Spirit to navigate the path He has set before me. What I didn't understand yesterday is becoming clearer today. And what I don't understand today will become clear tomorrow. I don't mean the literal sense of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. But you get the idea. I cannot comprehend any of it without being in consistent and constant communication with God through prayer and reading of the Word.

I want to choose to rejoice always and delight in my faith. I'm grateful and thankful for the life God has given me. I don't always like my circumstances. However, I do not need to like them to appreciate what God is doing through it all. I can still rejoice because I can trust that God knows what I need when I need it. Everything happens in accordance to His Will and timing. When I put my trust in God, praying for His Will to be done, then my circumstances won't seem so bad.
