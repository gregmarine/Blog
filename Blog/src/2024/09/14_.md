# TBD

Happy Saturday!!! And welcome to another day with meeeeeee....LOL I'm not going to do a timestamp entry today. But I'll likely journal throughout the day anyway. When I do a timestamp entry, I try to say what I want to say within 15-20 minutes of time. The time I put down is the start time of that interval, rounded to the nearest five. I don't do this conscientiously really. It just sort of happens and is an observation. Today, I wanted to just try journaling all day without thinking about the time...hehehe

This morning's prayer walk was three times as long as usual. I typically just do one lap around the pond. That's a third of a mile. Today, I decided to do a full mile. After having done so, I think I may make that a regular thing. If my time is constrained a little, I may just do a single lap. And there are those rare days when either I cannot due to weather or sometimes I'm not home. There are also the rare times when I'm home but have plans that require me to leave without doing the prayer walk.

In a few weeks, I will have started my day with Jesus every morning for a year. I've spent time with Him most days for the past three years. But I made the commitment to *start* my day with Him at the beginning of October last year. Regardless of what I'm doing for the day, I spend several minutes in prayer and meditation before I get out of bed. I sit up and dangle my legs off the side. I'll even wait to go to the bathroom until after that prayer...hehehe

What I do after that has changed over the course of the year. Sometimes, I've had to move my devotional time to later in the day as I adjust my schedule or if my mornings involve other people. But most of this year, a devotional of some kind was part of those first hours of the day. Nothing in my life has made more of a positive impact on my life than spending time with Jesus to start my day.

This weekend marks the six month milestone of my devotional fellowship with Cherie. I've likely mentioned that a time or two. But I mentioned it again today because it is just that important. Not that the importance is specific to either of us. The importance I speak of is how God inspired us to begin doing it. And having been doing it for six months, it is now quite clear how much we've both grown closer to Jesus in the process. I'm grateful for how it has drawn me closer to Him. And I'm grateful He called us both to do this together.

I've always been one to make mental notes of dates, time frames, and the importance of progress. I celebrate these things because they help me acknowledge what God has done, is doing, and will be doing in my life and that of the lives of those I cherish the most. It helps me to avoid being stuck in the past, be fearful of the future, and remain focused on what it is I need to be doing today. The devotional season I've been in these past six months have helped me take that one step further. To sum it up, all I have to do today is trust in and follow Jesus. Everything else will fall into place.
