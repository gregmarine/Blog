## Before and After Text

Well, I slept on it. I've prayed about it. And I believe the answer is to let lying dogs lie. It was a brief moment of reacting to the text. I know for certain they did not intent to cause any sting. They were simply telling me that the way I looked before wasn't any less beautiful than how I look today. And they just don't know me well enough to know what I was feeling 7 years ago.

When I was obese, had long hair, and that hideous beard, I was at a time in my life when my outward appears directly reflected my inward state of being. I purposefully let myself go in every way physically because my soul was in anguish. There were other signs that I was suffering inside. But my outward appearance seemed to most to just be how I was built. It was not.

My friend just didn't know me at the time. And most people didn't know I was doing this to myself to help cope with those inner demons. So, just as I let go of my former self, I'm letting go of that text yesterday.
