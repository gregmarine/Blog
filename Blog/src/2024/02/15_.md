## 7:55 am

I've been a little off as of late. Based on past experience, I feel it might be the onset of depression. I've had several work days were I felt like I needed to take a mental health day but didn't. I've been sort of *white knuckling* through each day telling myself it will pass.

I woke up with so much anxiety today that I finally pulled the plug and took the day off. I have plenty of time off. If I save it, I will get a payout once the transition to the new company happens. However, there is still value in taking some time off between now and then. On a day like today, I felt I really needed it. So there is more value in my taking the day off than in saving the time for a payout later.

Although I'm at a slower pace, I'm going about my morning otherwise the same as I would normally. I started with my daily morning prayer wake up time and daily Bible app refresh. Regardless how I feel, I've been consistent with that for the past 138 days now. It helps shape my attitude for the day. So I do not see myself ever missing that part. Consistency is a great thing. Especially for how my mind seems to work.

After that, I didn't actually do my next consistent thing, however. Instead of doing one of my devotionals, I decided to check my texts and emails. I never do that so early in the day. It's typically 2-3 hours after I wake before I get around to doing that. But part of the reason I did that today was because I needed to send a text to my boss letting him know that I was taking the day off.

After slowly meandering through those messages, I eventually got up to shave and shower. One thing I have taken away from all the counseling I've been through is that when I'm depressed, I really need to take care of myself. I wasn't filthy and my face and head didn't really look like they needed shaving. But doing those tasks when I'm feeling the way I do are actually quite therapeutic and therefore necessary.

I then made my coffee and poured my orange juice. And now I'm starting today's journal entry. I chose to write before doing any of my devotionals because I just needed to get some of this out. Writing has helped me immensely this year. I'd like to remain fairly consistent with writing. I may even start keeping my iPad with me where ever I roam. I'd like to start bringing it with me to Disney as well. Perhaps I'll end up at Disney today...hehehe If I do go, I'll be sure to bring my iPad with me so I can continue to write throughout the day.

## 12:03 pm

I decided to go to Disney! Right now, I'm sitting at the Garden Grill at EPCOT. This is my first time experience this restaurant. It's a character dining experience with Chip, Dale, Mickey, and Pluto. As of now, I've already met Chip, Dale, and Mickey. I brought Olaf with me. So he has gotten his picture taken with all of them so far...hehehe

I also reserved a spot for the Festival entertainment. It is a set of Disney on Broadway performances at the American pavilion later this evening. I've experienced that before in the past. But this time I should be up close I believe.

My meal is plant-based for the most part. I went with the vegetarian option. It looks so good! Let's dig in!

Oh, real quick, Pluto just stopped by! Olaf got his picture. And Pluto wanted to take a selfie with me too...hehehe So we all got a picture together! Yay!!!

## 1:17 pm

Lunch was so wonderful. The food was fantastic. The ambience was Zen. The Cast were amazing! I ate way too much. But that's what you do when it is all you care to eat family style and you are a party of one...HAHAHA

Olaf had a great time getting his photo take with the characters and the always changing scenery.

The vegetarian option was perfect! Of all the places I go to eat these days, Disney does it right. Whatever your diet is, Disney has an option for you. If your dietary needs aren't listed, a chef will come to your table to discuss your needs with you. At least that's the experience I've personally had at Walt Disney World over this past year.

I'm not sitting in the World Celebration area of EPCOT. It's the new garden area that recently opened at the close of 2023. It looks like a great place to escape the crowds. It is also a great place to sit and write. The background sounds aren't very distracting. And there are plenty of places to just sit and plenty of places to set up a computer to work. There are power outlets throughout to charge phones or power computers. I'm currently at 92% battery on my iPad. So I feel I'll be good today...hehehe

I can certainly see myself working from here sometime. It seemed like a busy day when I arrived. But in this area, the crowd is minimal. No one around is in a hurry. Everyone is just taking the opportunity to relax. And I'm just typing away...LOL

## 2:07 pm

After a relaxing time in World Celebration, I took a stroll through one of the art districts. EPCOT is currently featuring the International Festival of the Arts. I believe this is the third time I've been here during this festival. The other times, I focused on food and drinks. Today, I"m focused mostly on the other arts...performance and visual.

I'm currently taking a break from the sun in the Mexico pavilion. I'm right across from the gate where I entered the World Showcase during my runDisney 5K last November. It's fun reliving the moments of that momentous event of my life. It is still hard to believe I did that. And it is equally hard to believe it really wasn't the long ago. Yet here I am over 20 lbs lighter than I was that day...LOL

Back to that food at the Garden Grill! Wow! I didn't realize that eating vegetarian would be so rewarding. Although I definitely over ate, I'm not feeling it as heavy as if it would have been flesh meats. I feel like I could run another 5K through EPCOT right now...hehehe If it had been flesh meats, I'd probably have the meat sweats...HAHAHA

The park doesn't seem so busy now. I imagine the crowds I saw earlier were just folks arriving. It was close to 11 am when I arrived. That is the time when most of the food opens up. The only people who seem to come before 11 here are those rope dropping the rides.

I often wonder who comes to Disney on a weekday in the middle of February. School is still in session and it really isn't a vacation season. But the weather is fantastic for a day at the parks. It isn't hot. It isn't cold. As Goldilocks might say, it's just right. Perhaps that has something to do with it. I have my doubts that all of these other people are here for a mental health day, like myself.

## 2:33 pm

I'm now sitting in the African Outpost. It's between the China and Germany pavilions. I'm reflecting on what a mental health day is for me. There really isn't a definition that I subscribe to beyond just taking a break from *my normal*.

So, I've identified that I am in a depression. I'm sure the situation at work as some part in why I might be depressed. I mean, it is a loss. It doesn't quite equate to watching a loved one pass away. But in a small way, it is a terminal diagnosis. Regardless of what will happen in the next few months, I'll no longer be at the company I thought I would be retiring at.

It hasn't been that long that I've contemplated my retirement. I'll only be 46 next month. So I'd say I have at least 20 more years of actual labor still. But as I have mentioned before, I was hoping to retire from this career within the next 5-10 years. With that retirement in mind, I really didn't want to go anywhere else.

There is also this sense of loss of some of my friends. I made so many new ones last year. But are they truly friends? We say *my friend* when I say things like thank you...such as *thank you, my friend*. I feel as though I have lost them now because I don't want to do all those meetups anymore. I tried it. I didn't like it.

I mentioned last Friday that I was thinking about giving up on Disney. At least my annual pass. I've since reconsidered. Ch√©rie reached out to me about that and said just what I needed to hear. It isn't *Disney* that I was having my issue with. It was the constant hanging out. I wasn't able to always be my authentic self in those environments. They all seem like great people. But we just didn't bring out the best of each other.

Today is my third time coming here in the last six days. I've had more enjoyment in these three visits than most of those meetups last year. I'm more of a solo or one on one personality. I may still do the occasional meetup, like the one coming up in a few weeks. But I'll try to keep the boundary I have established so far this year. I'll come when I feel like being alone and not let anyone know my plans. When I feel like see people, I'll let them know I'm coming.

Talking this out does make me feel better. Well, writing it out in this case. It gets it out of my head. One of the cycles of my depression is when something gets stuck in my head. It rolls around in there like a pair of socks in the laundry. It gets all twisted up with everything else. And sometimes, one of the socks gets lost...hehehe I don't want to get lost in my thoughts. That is, unless it is getting lost in watching a bird soar or a tree swaying in the breeze. That's a completely different type of lost...hehehe

Time to move on...
