# No Words

There are no words strong enough for how I am feeling right now. The goodness of God I have been experiencing cannot be described. I often wonder if certain things were left out of the Bible for the very same reason I feel right now. Some things seem to only be explainable in spiritual terms that have no words.

I sometimes try to write what I'm experiencing and how I am feeling. I suppose some of what I say and write is *good enough* to convey something. I've learned to accept that I cannot always translate what is in my soul in a way that would communicate it well to another person. Is that okay? I hope so. Is it that I feel I want to communicate, or do I feel everyone needs to know, how I feel? For now, there will be times when there simply are no words.

I'm back to work today. I've been off for the past four days. It feels good to be back at the job. There is a lot going on right now and I've been keeping busy. Last week was a great week of productivity that set me up to have a great week this week as well. I hope to accomplish quite a bit in the week to come.

I'm pondering my trip to Indiana. I plan to drive. So, I'll travel on the weekends as to not need to take time off work. I haven't decided if I'll be there for one week or two. With all that is going on with work, one week seems smart. But I may also be able to make it work out to be more productive if I remain up there for two. So many things to consider...hehehe

One thought I had was to rent a workspace or find some other place to go other than my parents' house. Regardless where I work from, meetings are the hardest part. I don't have a good headset. The software we use for meetings doesn't handle hardware well. Everyone that uses any sort of headset or headphones seems to struggle on calls. I just use the laptop. But I always work from somewhere that allows me to do that...like a speakerphone setup. If I'm somewhere that I cannot do that, I simply do not do those meetings...LOL Or I put myself in *Do Not Disturb*...LOL Yeah, I cannot do that for two full weeks...LOL
