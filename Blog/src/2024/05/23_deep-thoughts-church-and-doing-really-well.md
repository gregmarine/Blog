# Deep Thoughts, Church, and Doing Really Well

I’m incredibly blessed. I just needed to say that out loud.

::: warning
Deep thought coming in…hehehe Read this another time or skip it if your headspace isn’t ready for the deep. These aren’t my deepest thoughts. But they feel much deeper than I’ve gone up to this point in my journal. Feel free to skip to [Church](#church) if you’d like. That, and everything beyond, is pretty surface level…LOL

## Deep Thoughts, by Greg Marine 🤭

Time and space are a construct we bind our minds and bodies to in order to measure our lives. When we are conceived, the cover of our book is drawn. When we die, *The End* is written on the final page and the book is closed. The pages of the book are filled with the moments and experiences of our lives as written by the choices we and others make along the way. Each chapter describes in great detail the many seasons we go through from the title page until the last. However, the Author of our existence already knows what the story will be and how it will be told. He is not bound by space or time. He is the *I am*. In the *Lamb’s Book of Life*, our entire book is but a single chapter. Our book gets tossed out (all of the burdens, anxiety, fears, mistakes, sins) and we become a part of *HisStory* (all of the faith, hope, love). I love searching through the pages of The Word. Every time that I do, I find new and exciting attributes of the Author of my life. I will never know the vastness of His knowledge. I’m not meant to. I will rest in the fact He is the one in control of my chapter of *HisStory*.

That thought was sparked by my recent conversations with people I will soon meet in person for the first time. From a human perspective, I have not yet officially *met* them. From a Kingdom perspective, however, we have *already* met. We have always known each other; although we could not yet perceive it. I’m exercising the concept of stepping out of time and space to look at existence through God’s lens. Obviously I cannot physically do such a thing. I’m not meant to. If I were to actually do that, I’ll likely die…hehehe A true out of body experience seems too inconceivable to fathom. How can I, a mere human, be like God. I cannot and will not ever attempt to. I am a sinful man and unworthy of such glory. In fact, that is straight out blasphemy! So, why is my mind even going there. I’m asking God to help me see people the way He does. As I read the stories of the New Testament and see how Jesus viewed people, I can’t help but want to be *like* Jesus. For me to have compassion the way He does, I feel as though I need to be unbound from space or time.

Those boundaries keep me comfortable and make me feel safe. As a human, I want to feel safe and comfortable. As a Christ follower, I want to step out of my comfort zone and boldly proclaim the Good News of His salvation. But that said, I’m grateful for the boundaries of time and space. Sure, they make me feel comfortable. However, they also keep me from becoming proud. Rather than boast in my own abilities and understanding, I boast about the Spirit of God living in me. His power is made perfect in my weakness. He has bound me to space and time in order to Glorify Himself through those boundaries. He tells me, that in my chapter of *HisStory*, these are the people, places, and things He wants me to love and care for. He has ordained these moments before any of them came to be. I’m grateful for being a chapter of His book. I’m grateful for the choice I have to pursue His Will in my life. And I’m grateful for these people I will soon meet in our time and space. I pray He will continue to show me how I can love them with agape love.

I don’t really know what I’m talking about here…hehehe I don’t even really know what I’m saying. I’m just thinking thoughts and writing them out. But something I’m not saying is that we are somehow on a predetermined path. God gave us free will. His knowledge of our choices and having ordained our days simply means He is allowing them as our Creator. He sees and knows all. That’s how He can have already written our stories. I draw that conclusion from Psalm 139. I cannot possibly understand how that works or why it is. And I’ll never pretend to know or understand it. I just know He is God and I am not…LOL That’s why I want to look to Him as my guide. He is my Light and He directs my path.

::: details Psalm 139 AMP
1 O Lord, you have searched me [thoroughly] and have known me. 2 You know when I sit down and when I rise up [my entire life, everything I do]; You understand my thought from afar. [Matt 9:4; John 2:24, 25] 3 You scrutinize my path and my lying down, And You are intimately acquainted with all my ways. 4 Even before there is a word on my tongue [still unspoken], Behold, O Lord, You know it all. [Heb 4:13] 5 You have enclosed me behind and before, And [You have] placed Your hand upon me. 6 Such [infinite] knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is too high [above me], I cannot reach it. 7 ¶Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? 8 If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), behold, You are there. [Rom 11:33] 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, 10 Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will take hold of me. 11 If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, And the night will be the only light around me,” 12 Even the darkness is not dark to You and conceals nothing from You, But the night shines as bright as the day; Darkness and light are alike to You. [Dan 2:22] 13 ¶For You formed my innermost parts; You knit me [together] in my mother’s womb. 14 I will give thanks and praise to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. 15 My frame was not hidden from You, When I was being formed in secret, And intricately and skillfully formed [as if embroidered with many colors] in the depths of the earth. 16 Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were appointed for me, When as yet there was not one of them [even taking shape]. 17 ¶How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! [Ps 40:5] 18 If I could count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You. 19 ¶O that You would kill the wicked, O God; Go away from me, therefore, men of bloodshed. [Is 11:4] 20 For they speak against You wickedly, Your enemies take Your name in vain. [Jude 15] 21 Do I not hate those who hate You, O Lord? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? 22 I hate them with perfect and utmost hatred; They have become my enemies. 23 ¶Search me [thoroughly], O God, and know my heart; Test me and know my anxious thoughts; 24 And see if there is any wicked or hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.

## Church

Now that the deep thought is out of the way, it’s time to talk about something I am struggling with that isn’t so deep. It is possible there is something deep going on that is impacting this surface level struggle. But I’m not ready to go there just yet. For a few months now, I have wrestled with leaving my current church. I haven’t really been looking for a new church and have continued to worship there as often as I have been able. After my sudden exit this past Sunday, I began to wonder if it were possible I left because of this struggle. At the time, I believed I was called by God to get up and walk out. I still believe that today. Nothing triggered my exit. Nothing was said or done in that moment that caused me to want to leave. In fact, I didn’t want to leave at all. I still believe it was a calling. And this has gotten me to ponder the meaning of all of that this week. I wanted to discuss this with Kerry on Tuesday for what had been our weekly fellowship. He wasn’t able to come due to other commitments and he indicated those commitments were going to keep him from getting together as often as we had previously been doing. It seems as though our fellowship is coming to an end, actually. Which further supports my leaving this church. I don’t go to church for anyone other than myself and my relationship with God. But the relationships I have with people are an important aspect of being a part of a church family. In the 20 or so months I have attended this church, I have struggled to connect with others. Part of that is my own insecurities and social anxieties. However, even when I began to seemingly connect with others, those relationships kept falling away. It’s a large church. Part of that is comforting because I am often able to simply blend in and not face my social anxiety and insecurity. Yet, I can’t help but feel as though I need the closeness of fellowship. I grew up in a small church and fellowship was strong. Although I have been involved with large churches before, this one seems to be too large for the sort of fellowship God wants for me.

From my reflection in today’s *Elevation Worship - Wake Up The Wonder* devotional:

> I am a broken man. My soul cries out. I am unworthy of God’s Grace and Truth. I deserve death and nothing more. Yet, Christ came, showed me how to live, died the death I deserve, and overcame death in His Resurrection. He calls me to rise with Him. He calls me to adore Him. To worship His Holy Name. I am forever grateful for the loving kindness He pours out into my spirit. Jesus fills the cracks of my brokenness and dries up my tears. His Salvation replaces my worthlessness. His Grace and Truth reveal who He calls me to be! I kneel before my Lord and my Creator. The Author of my chapter of *HisStory*.

Anyway, I’m not sure what I’ll do about church. I’m definitely talking with God about it. I’ve been virtually attending church with Chérie for nearly 3 months now. What I find fascinating is how I feel closer in fellowship with a church and 1 of its members from 2000 miles away than I do with a church and all of its members combined just 8 miles away. As crazy as that sounds, it does remind me of how I’m following a man who walked this earth 2000 years ago. This paradoxical conundrum can begin to make sense when I apply my deep thought from above. As a strip away both space and time, stripping away my human understanding, I can have a perspective on this circumstance that brings me Peace. Regardless of where I am, God meets *me* there. No matter where I worship and with whom, God meets *us* there. When, where, and how all become meaningless when I surrender to God’s Will for my life. It does not have to make any sense to me whatsoever. I humbly ask the Lord to guide and direct my path so that I am where I need to be when I need to be there and with whom I need to be with as I worship Him. A discerning spirit is an absolute necessity for such a huge decision.

## On the Lighter Side

I’m starting to feel back on track with my physical activity. I’ve been walking every day this week. I typically do a single lap in the morning. But then I’ll do just over 3 miles (10 laps) in the evening. This, coupled with my return to the kitchen, has me feeling really well physically right now. In the kitchen, I’ve even attempted new recipes and haven’t had the epic fails I did a few weeks ago. The only issue I’m having is some upper back pain. That part of my body is like, *whoa there fella…we haven’t been doing this for a bit…take it easy there partner*…LOL

Work has been business as usual. I really wish I could talk about what it is I actually do…hehehe But nothing yet to report on the status of my employment. It is as it was and seems to be continuing for the foreseeable future. I’m glad I didn’t panic in January when we got the news of the upcoming changes. Some folks did and bailed quickly. Other folks, similar to me, are simply riding out the waves as they approach.

But one change I am making now is I’m going to start traveling. I had hoped to travel this year and abruptly halted all planning at the news from my company. Now that I’m 4 months into this, I’ve decided planning can begin again. I had stopped traveling almost 3 years ago; other than trips back to Indiana. Now, I plan to travel elsewhere. I’ll still visit family and friends in Indiana. But my focus now is on other adventures. I still have some anxiety about it. But nothing like it was. Now, it’s more of a nervous happy energy. The kind that comes from excitement about what I’ll experience as I venture out once again.

With all of the deep stuff in the beginning of this entry, I wanted to end it with lighter topics. And I also wanted to say I’m doing really well. Not just well…*really* well. As I stated in the beginning, I’m incredibly blessed. And as I’ve mentioned a few other times, my circumstances haven’t improved. But my heart sure has!
