## Disney Dinner

I had a lovely dinner with my brother and his family last night. We went to Roundup Rodeo BBQ in Disney's Hollywood Studios. This Toy Story themed restaurant is so much fun! There are times when the toy soldiers *radio in* to tell us the *toys* that Andy is on his way...hehehe So everyone, Cast and guests both, freeze as if we are all toys from the movie...hehehe

The food is served family style. His family can eat quite a bit! So I'm glad I was there with them. The last time I went, there were just 2 of us. And neither of us ate much. So there was a lot of wasted food. We didn't waste much last night...LOL

As you probably guessed from the restaurant's name, the food is BBQ. It is all pretty good and worth the price based on Disney pricing. It's actually one of the cheaper meals. Especially for family style dining. The decor is all large cutout looking things as if it were from a box the toys came packaged in. It's like Andy created the restaurant as a play set in his bedroom...hehehe

## Holy Week

Holy Week has been like a warm hug for me. Although I have attended church on Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, and Easter Sunday before, this is the first year I have *attended* church each day. By that I mean that I've been able to tune in live for the CCGS services this week, as I've previously talked about.

Just like my devotionals I've been working through, these services have been directly related to prayers I've had on my heart and mind lately. I know these sermons are applicable to most people. But it is as if God is speaking directly to me...hehehe

Like I mentioned yesterday (I believe), I think I'd like to go back and watch the sermons again next week and dissect the lessons and scripture. I want to dive deep into what all of the events of this week were and meant to help establish the Christian faith. I've never truly done that before. I've heard these stories my whole life. Yet, I've never understood what most of it truly meant.

On Sunday, I expressed an opinion I've had for most of my life. I finally wrote it out because I wanted to personally challenge that opinion. I don't know who shares in my opinions or who completely disagree with me. Regardless, my opinions are mine and mine alone. When I put one out there, I want to challenge it to see if it remains an opinion or if it something that is a fundamental belief.

Some opinions or beliefs don't really make an impact on who I am deep down. When it comes to the ones related to my faith in God, those are the ones which truly impact all of who I am. So, this is an important personal project of mine. God is providing some new insight through the events and services this week. Events being ones that are occurring to me personally in this actual week. I don't mean the events of the week 2k years ago...hehehe But the services this week, I'm definitely speaking of CCGS...hehehe
