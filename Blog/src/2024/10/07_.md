# TBD

This is week three of a complete disruption of my routine...LOL Two weeks ago, a hurricane was coming through. I ended up at Disney for three days. I worked two of those days from a few hotels. I felt a little displaced. But it was a great time and God led me to some amazing things. Last week, my parents were here. So, once again, my routine was way off. I had such a great time with my parents and I was able to see my sister several times as well. This week, it's another hurricane...LOL

In the past, having a disruption in my routine for a few days wasn't much of an issue. But having a disruption for weeks would have thrown me off balance...hehehe It would have increased my stress and anxiety to levels that would require me to find rest or do whatever I could to get back to my routine. In other words, I would have been a mess...LOL

It could be the growth I've experienced this year through my daily walk with Jesus, but I can honestly say that I'm at complete peace right now. Having not been able to do my routine for weeks already, plus not being able to get back to it this week, hasn't thrown me out of balance at all. Yet, here I am writing about how well I feel...hehehe

Just before this disruption began, I had achieved a routine I absolutely love. I might even go so far as to say it was the perfect routine for me...hehehe I jokingly think God must have seen how perfect I thought it was and decided to throw a wrench in it...LOL I don't actually believe that, though. On the contrary, I believe that He prepared me for this period of disruption. He had to have known and gave me the scriptures to make sure I knew where I needed to draw from to find peace in the chaos of my schedule these past few weeks...hehehe

This is how I've been seeing all of the circumstances I've faced my entire life. Now that I look back on it all and see where Jesus was, I'm now able to see how He allowed certain circumstances and what He taught me along the way. I sure wish I had always looked at my life this way...LOL But I'm glad I look at it that way now. The growth I've been experiencing is a blessing. What God has been doing in my life cannot truly be described. But I'll gladly acknowledge that it is so amazing.
