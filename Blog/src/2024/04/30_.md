# TBD

This morning started out a bit rough. Between not feeling well physically this week, and some things getting triggered mentally, waking up today wasn't fun...hehehe Thankfully I have the mental strength through Jesus to still get up, do my early devotions, make my bed, shave my head and face, and get dressed...LOL I try to do that each day regardless of how I'm feeling when I wake up. I wasn't going to go for a walk because I'm physically under the weather. But I decided to do it anyway. It was a short distanced but took me quite a while to do. I'm sure if anyone saw me, they knew something must be wrong...hehehe I was definitely not my chipper bouncy self walking around the pond. But that's okay. I'm glad I took the walk.
