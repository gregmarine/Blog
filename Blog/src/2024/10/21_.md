I've been struggling with my writing. Once again, I've written quite a bit. All unpublished. I never seem to finish my thoughts. And my routine has been a bit chaotic lately. It has been over four weeks now since I've felt like my days have been normal...LOL I honestly don't feel like this week will be any different. I'm considering trying a new routine altogether since I can't seem to get back into what was working a month ago...hehehe

I just finished reading Cherie's latest journal entry and watching her video from this past weekend. It looked like she had such a lovely day in LA. That makes my heart so happy. There were a few familiar things in the video from our day in July...hehehe I'm so glad she was able to experience the rose garden on her own. It was one of the places we talked about going to had I been able to go in September. But her being able to experience it on her own for the first time this past Saturday makes my heart so happy <3 In a way, I was still there. She sent me a little video and a photo from there. So I was there in spirit...hehehe

My day has started off quite different than most days. My prayer time to start the day was completely different than anything I've ever experienced since I started doing it over a year ago. This time, I woke up praying. It was like I had been dreaming it and then was doing it in real life. But I wasn't speaking the words aloud. It was just in my heart. I'm unaware of how long I was praying. So many things came to my heart and I prayed about them all. I have no idea if this will happen again. I typically make the prayer the first conscious thing I do for the day. In this case, it began from an unconscious state and transitioned into the conscious. So, not exactly something I can plan...LOL I've had similar experiences before. However, those were in the middle of the night and not when I was waking for the day.

I have a bit of a healthy anxiety about what is coming next for my life. It's an excitement with a little bit of fear of the unknown. There is Soul Construction Ahead...Proceed with Prayer.

## 10:00am

My morning at work hasn't gone quite like I thought it would...hehehe But that's a good thing! I've been much busier than expected for a Monday morning. Things are really starting to pick up in regard to the overall transfer of responsibilities from my old company to the new. It has been happening in phases. The first phases were all about getting people moved over, called re-badging. This past weekend had an event where they did something called re-branding. That involved changes the company names on all correspondence with customers. I think the websites crossed over as well. I believe customers were notified of this change a little bit ago. Well, now they will start seeing things as my new company...hehehe

The phase I'm personally in is all about transferring data and source code over. That process is very detailed for what it is. We can't simply just copy and paste files across the networks. Everything...and I do mean *everything*...needs to be reviewed by a team of reviewers before it gets transferred. So, I have to zip up all of the source code for my team, drop it in a *for review* folder, add a line to a ledger that says something needs to be reviewed, and then wait for the reviewers to examine the files...LOL After that, assuming the files are approved for transfer, there is yet another team of people who will actually transfer the files over to the new company. Once that is complete, I'll hopefully get notified so I can unpack the files and get them ready for use on the other side...hehehe

We are still months away from the final phases of this effort. It is a long process. In the end, all will work out. It always does. I'm not stressing about any of it. Some of my colleagues seem to be stressing. So, I'm doing all that I can to make their lives a bit easier. For me, I see where this is going and I can see the tasks that need to be done. Doing everything as it comes instead of becoming overwhelmed is working for me. I do the task that is right before me. Then I start to think about the next task. I haven't always been like this. I use to get overwhelmed looking at everything all at once...hehehe I have grown so much...LOL
