[I watched *The Chosen* S4E3 last night. In it, Ramah was stabbed through the back by Quintus. Of course, she died. She is played by Yasmine Al-Bustami. How she carried herself as the Ramah character reminded me of Chérie. When I first started watching *The Chosen*, I had a crush on Chérie. After we discussed whether or not she saw us ever being romantically involved in the future, her response led me to settle the matter in my heart. I decided to let go of my crush. Although she is my very deer friend, she is not *mine* to hope for. She belongs to God. So my crush is no more. Watching the Ramah character pass away left me with a feeling of Peace as I knew she was going to be with God now. I wasn't sad or upset about the scene. I simply felt Peace. Sure, she's a fictional character. But the symbolism of someone I cared very much for being gone from my life for only a moment brought me Peace. I drew a connection between the Ramah and Thomas characters to my relationship with Chérie. I'll cherish my time with her as my deer friend on our current path. But I am grateful that my heart is free from the agony of not having more of her. She is God's. And I will be standing by her side when we praise God together in Heaven. I'll never ask her for more than she freely gives me. If she wants to give me more someday, I'll gladly receive it. I'm grateful for all she gives me today. And if she ever leaves my life, for whatever reason, I'll remain grateful for all I've received from her. She is a Blessing...always. I'll miss the Ramah character. As will Thomas, her betrothed. It's a fictional storyline for the narrative of *The Chosen*. However, it was a welcome one. It reminds me of the importance of embracing the moment with the ones I care most about while I have them. In a few weeks, I'll get to spend time face-to-face with Chérie. I'll add those memories to the album I store in my heart that is labeled *My Deerest Chérie*. I'll continue being the true friend she desires and deserves. I'll love her with agape love because my own love isn't good enough.]: #

It is well with my soul. I don't really want to describe what happened last night. But something interesting did happened. And a calmness and peace flooded my soul beyond any I have experienced before; as a result of what happened. I would love to always feel that way...hehehe Alas, that isn't how life works...LOL I could go into great detail about what it is I saw/experienced and how I responded to it. But I feel as though it was a moment for just my memory. I am only bringing it up in my journal to hopefully be a reminder someday that, although the sword may cut through the back of expectation, I should remain with Him always without any doubts about His Love. And I should always be grateful for what I receive from those I care most for. They may not always be with me. But cherishing who they are now, and then the memories we share after they're gone, is so important. And I should never expect more than what I receive. I'm not meant to have everything I think I want. *With an attitude of gratitude, let's accept what is meant for us today. And reject what isn't!* (Today's Vitamin G)

I don't know what it is, why it is, or if anyone else experiences this...but I often draw connections in my mind between stories I watch or read with the personal experiences I have with people I have a relationship with. It's kinda fun to see us playing a role in some epic story. I suppose some of the characters I see or read about remind me of someone important in my life. So it is as if I'm watching their life unfold in some fantastical or romantic fashion. I then place myself in the role of the sidekick...hehehe Likewise, I am reminded of myself in some characters. I play the lead role and I mentally invite friends and family to play the parts of the supporting characters in my own narrative. It probably sounds silly. But I do have that silly side of me. So, I love it!

So, I've evolved my routine and schedule a bit more...hehehe

I was taken off the new project...LOL
