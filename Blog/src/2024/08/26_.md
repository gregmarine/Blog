# TBD

I'll start off by addressing the *elephant in the room*. I haven't yet finished journaling about my time in North Carolina...LOL I experienced several wonderful things and I took photos and videos along the way. I'm unlikely to post the videos on this journal because I'm not quite sure how that works really. But I'll continue posting the photos...hehehe However, today, I wanted to do a general journal entry.

I failed to be consistent with my journaling on this trip simply because I filled up my time quite a bit more than the trip I did in California. There isn't any particular reason why I did things a little different this time. Each journey is unique. The main goals were the same. The execution was appropriate for the locations I landed in.

That said, one of the things I wanted to write about today is how I'm going to be pausing my search for a new home. The main goal of both trips was to get a feel for those areas. God allowed that to teach me a few things. But all of my attempts to plan such a trip in September have been met with closing doors...hehehe I also received some new insights to places I previously took off the table. So, for now, I'm going to consider September a stay at home month. That's okay. I wasn't disappointed when none of the plans were working out...LOL

I have been reminiscing about my early life in my hometown of Mooresville, Indiana. To this day, I consider it a quiet small town feel. It has grown. But its essence remains small town feel. There are still a lot of places one can live there and rarely need to drive. And the downtown streets have been *cleaned up* a bit. It was never a dirty place. It's just that buildings have a fresh coat of paint and sidewalks have been repaired over the years. Several of those downtown buildings have retained their late 1800s/early 1900s facades. And things like the old bars have been replaced with things like coffee shops.
