# Short Title

Today's *The Chosen* devotional (Book 3, Day 5) was quite inspirational. The main topic was envy. But it triggers a reflection on what I'm most grateful for in my life. In the *Prayer Focus*, it called me to write a note page worth of Blessings and to thank God for each one. I stuck to a single note page for it. But I've found that I'm grateful for so much more than what I wrote on that page.

The majority of the Blessings I wrote about were people. I talked about Ch√©rie, Malachi, Dan, my parents, siblings, and Tyrese. I did got a little into my health, home, food, job, resources, and my life in general. I concluded with being most grateful for God Himself. I *saved* Him for last because He is the most important part of my gratitude. Without Him, there are no Blessings...hehehe

What I loved most about staring my reflection notes with the *Prayer Focus* today was that by focusing on what I was grateful for first helped align my heart for a lesson on envy. Envy, and comparison, are the thief of joy. I can defeat envy by posturing myself with Joy first. Not that envy is a real issue today. But I've definitely allowed it to impact me before. Spending so much time this year with Jesus has been a life changing experience in my attitude of gratitude.








A quick explanation for today's title...hehehe Yesterday's was comically long. I write from my MacBook Pro. I take a quick look at the entries from my desktop browser before I publish them. I don't think about how long they are when viewing from my desktop screen because all looks fine there. It isn't until after they are published before I check them out from my phone. Well, yesterday's title was quite a bit wider than my phone's screen...LOL So today, I decided to go with a short title...literally...hehehe I love being silly sometimes ;P
