# TBD

It was a bit of a *rough* morning. I use that word loosely. At the 30k foot view, it as a fantastic morning. But there was a moment of stress that reminded me of a *scary* part of myself. Again, I'm using *that* word loosely as well...hehehe That brief moment of stress made me feel like I might have actually gotten angry. It has been so long since I've been angry that I don't even remember when that was. I didn't want today to be the day when I'd have to restart that clock...LOL

I have a love/hate relationship with technology. When it works and I understand how it works, I love it...hehehe When it doesn't work or I don't understand how it works, I hate it...ugh! Once again, I felt really old today for a brief moment. The technology was working just fine. I just didn't understand how it worked...LOL Another way to say it, it wasn't working the way I thought it should...hehehe I can be a square peg trying to fit into a round hole sometimes. So I walked away...hehehe

It's my understanding that cortisol is the stress hormone. My guess is that what I was experiencing caused my body to produce an extra dose of cortisol to trigger my flight or fight response? It does a lot more than that. But I'm guessing it had something to do with how I felt in the moment in this context. A previous version of *Greg* would have fought the technology until it did what I wanted...LOL I decided to walk away...or take the flight approach...hehehe

What resulted was I ended up making posts on Instagram and Facebook in the Stories feature. What I wanted to do originally was produce a single video of 4 clips. It seemed like a simple task. But I couldn't get the apps I have to do what I wanted. They all kept making the video in the wrong aspect ratio...hehehe I use to produce videos all the time. But it had been a while. The apps work slightly differently than I remember. So the issue is definitely me. I'm sure it is just as simple today as it always has been. I just need to learn the new way...LOL I'm an *old dog*. *New tricks* take me a little longer...hehehe I prefer the old way of simplicity. The *bells and whistles* of a lot of today's apps confuse me. I just wanted to splice the videos in the aspect ratio I recorded them in. It seemed easy to me. I couldn't figure out the apps I have...LOL

Just to be clear, I just wanted a basic edit function to splice 4 videos together into one. No transitions and no sound. No fading and no text...hehehe When I want to produce a more complex video, the tools I have will be just fine. My view of the tools I have were too complicated for such a simple task. I asked Ch√©rie what she uses for the short videos she sends me sometimes. She uses *Splice*...LOL I laughed at the name of the app because the name says exactly what it was I wanted to do...hehehe I downloaded it and created the video I wanted to created this morning. It worked exactly as I expected...hehehe Too bad I didn't have it this morning...LOL Oh well. That's okay. I'm glad I have it for next time...hehehe
