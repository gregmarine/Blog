In our Bible study last week, the first *Your Turn* question was *What new thing are you afraid Jesus might lead you to?* I had two answers. One was related to the possibility God might be calling me to start a church. The other was about me being alone. For nearly three years, I have lived alone. I've also had friends nearby come and go in that time. And at the moment, I have no friends nearby whatsoever.

For all but these recent years, I've always had someone. And for many of those years, I was taking care of people in some manner. So, these past few years have been quite an adjustment for me. There were a couple of times when loneliness set and and I was borderline depressed. When I wrote that part of my answer, it was in the spirit of being afraid that I was being lead to a life of solitude in so much as living with no one and having no one nearby to be around. God has given me the means to go to people; which I gladly do. I'm grateful for the privilege of having the resources to go to family and friends where they are.
