# TBD

I almost went with another general journal entry today. I seem to have a lot to say lately...hehehe Well, I decided I should wrap up my NC trip and finally journal about my day last Friday...LOL I have a lot on my mind. But I also had a really great day that day. So, it wants me to talk about it...hehehe Here we go!

## The Flying Biscuit

One of my favorite things about travel is checking out local eateries. On this particular day, I knew we would be out hiking for a large portion of the day. So I asked Tye if we could go to breakfast. She offered a list of places that included McDonald's...hehehe One of the options a place called The Flying Biscuit Cafe. The name was enough for me to choose it...LOL Tye was grateful I didn't say McDonald's...hehehe
