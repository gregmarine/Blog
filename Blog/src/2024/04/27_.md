# Arboretum Day

## Shared Botanical Experience

Happy Arboretum Day!!! Yay!!! The day is finally here! For those who aren't me or Ch√©rie, her and I planned a day where she went to the arboretum near her in California and I went to a botanical gardens in Florida near me. While at each, we did a FaceTime video call to share in each other's experiences. A virtual walk through the park, if you will. I've not done anything quite like that before. I've video chatted several times. But going somewhere, each of us in a different location, to do a shared experienced, this was new and exciting! I would definitely love to do more such experiences.

I went to the Nature Coast Botanical Gardens for my half of the experience. It's a nice little place. With an emphasis on *little*, that meant I was able to walk through the entire garden a few times to her one loop around the arboretum...hehehe But that's okay. If we do this particular thing again, I may go to the Sunken Gardens in St. Pete. It's a bit larger and has a lot more to show. For this being a first time experience, I'm still quite happy with my choice of gardens. Just as I was leaving the gardens, I became a panda...LOL

## Grocery Blessings

Last week, I had a few items to pick up from the grocery and I decided to give Aldi a try again. I needed Pico de Gallo and ghee. As it turns out, the ghee they sell is a little subpar. I didn't know. The ghee I had previously purchased at Publix and Walmart looked the same. Apparently, all of the ghee I've gotten isn't at a high quality...hehehe Well, I didn't know. I'm new to ghee...LOL The Pico was pretty good, though.

I've had a hit or miss experience with Aldi. Some products turn out great for the price. Others, not so much. Besides ghee, another miss I've had there are their meats. I've had trusted people rave about the quality of their meats. Back when I still ate meat, I gave them a try. That was a one and done for me. I know quality meat...Aldi does not have quality meat...LOL Actually, I use to know quality meat. Now, I wouldn't trust me with that...hehehe So take this as opinion only and not advice...LOL

After I selected my ghee and Pico, I headed up front to the registers. There was a single cashier and a line of 5 people with shopping carts filled to the brim. Fortunately, I wasn't in any hurry. It was my lunch break. However, I live close and didn't mind the idea of waiting one bit. I've rushed most of my life. I'm done rushing. I'm learning to embrace the moment and be patient when necessary.

The gal in front of me, the last of the 5 that were in line as I approached the area, turned and looked at my humble two items. She offered to allow me to go before her as she showed me her cart full of groceries. Although the next moment was likely only one second, in my mind, time had paused for about a minute. I pondered whether or not I would accept this offer. In the past, I would typically decline out of what I would have called humility. Another thing I was considering was the fact that I was in no hurry whatsoever. Then I pondered what it might mean if I did accept the offer. That threw me into another thought tree. On one branch, would my accepting the offer make me look like I thought I was more important than her? On another branch, was this her one random act of kindness that she wanted to do that day? Then on yet another branch, why was I overthinking this!? All she was doing was offering me to go before her because I clearly wasn't going to take up much of her time by going before her...hehehe Before I allowed my mind to go into a tailspin, I needed to make the decision!



## So, I was thinking...

So, I've been practicing my "*So, I was thinking...*" pose...hehehe I think I'm nailing it...LOL What do you think!?!
