# TBD

Goodbye April showers! Hello May flowers! Oh wait...this is Florida...LOL We didn't have many April showers and the flowers bloom all year round...hehehe Well, welcome May! It's good to meet you!

I'm taking a break from social media. And I think this time it won't just be a break from posting. I am going to try and not be on social media at all. I'm tired of agonizing over it. Social media has been bringing me down quite a bit lately. Even some of the people I love to follow are dragging me down by their posts or replies to posts. Or rather, it is my reaction and not the people themselves. I own how I feel about what I read. And the technology itself is stressing me out. Last month, I tried to branch out and do Instagram Stories. I cannot express how stressful that was. It seems easy. But I do not find it easy. On one of my last attempts, I thought I had it all just the way I wanted. And then when I saw the results posted, the text I added was completely missing. I don't need that noise in my life. So I'm cutting it out. I'll likely never give stories a try again...LOL I wanted to make it work. But it just wasn't working for me. As for the rest, I'm taking a break for now. But there is the likelihood that I might not go back. Although I have met some amazing people through social media, the ecosystem as a whole is not good for me. It might be good for other people. I'm happy for them. I wish them the best. As for me, my heart is broken by it. My empathetic nature just can't handle it right now. And that's okay.

I posted the above photo on all my social media accounts at the end of the day yesterday. It represents the sun setting on my time on social media. I figured if this really is the end, I might as well make my last post one of the sun actually setting...LOL The photo was taken about a hour or so from the actually setting of the sun. But I think it works for its purpose. It's a sobering thought that I might not go back. I'm not really sad about it, though. If anything, it is more of a relief. I'm not sure if social media affects other people the way it has me. I know some folks have left specific platforms because they became too toxic for them. For me, it's social media as a whole now. It isn't just one specific platform. Of course, I haven't made up my mind just yet. This is just a thought for today. I haven't given myself a set goal to decide. And I haven't given my hiatus a time frame. It could be a few days. It could be a month. It could be permanent. I really do not know today. All I know is that for today, I will not be posting or scrolling...hehehe

I'm not sure what direction my writing is going. For now, the *Vitamin G* project has been sitting in the *freezer* of my mind. It isn't just on the back burner simmering. It's packed away and waiting for another day. I honestly thought it was going to happen this year. It is not. I do have a few other projects in mind that could still happen this year, though. As you can see from my journal, I'm writing quite a bit. There is plenty I have already written this year that could end up in a new project or spark something. I still have hope that I'll finish at least one book this year. If I don't, that's okay. I'm going to keep writing. I not only have this journal, but I am writing poetry. And I have photography to inspire some writing. Perhaps a photo book could happen too...hehehe And the current content of *Vitamin G* could end up being repurposed into something better than that original project. So, I'm not discouraged. I'm still quite inspired!

I'm always getting positive feedback on my writing and what I post on social media. I feel it is a gift and I want to share it with the world around me. I'm limiting myself when I consider leaving social media. But then again, I wrote and had an audience before social media was a thing. There are more than 8 billion people on the planet at the moment. I don't need to reach them all. In fact, I don't *need* to reach anyone. I write because it brings me joy. I publish it because I know it brings others joy. So, it is more of a *want* to share what I have to say. For now, I'll just keep writing here and my closest friends can read my thoughts if they want to.

I'm still in search of who *Greg* is. I'm going to go ahead and declare this a struggle...hehehe I keep thinking back to who I was 25 years ago. I'm not dwelling on the past. It's just that I was a confident person back then. I was so sure of who I was and what I was suppose to do with my life. I'm not going to go into what happened to change that, but I did make a crucial error that set me on the path that led me to today. I don't regret the decisions I made then. All that has happened since has made me who I am today. I just don't quite know who that is...LOL

I would like to at least get back to having confidence and knowing what direction I'd like to take my life. I've written about purpose and passion recently. I haven't quite landed on the specifics of either of those just yet. However, I have discovered a few things which are definitely not a part of my purpose or passion. That seems like a good thing at this point. Stripping away parts of me that I don't like or feel aren't a true part of who I am should help me narrow down who I am, what my purpose is, and what my passion is.

I'm sorry if this entry seems a little sad or depressing. It's actually much more upbeat than the one I wrote yesterday. Yesterday's was so down that I ended up not publishing it...hehehe Yesterday was kind of a rough day. Nothing majorly bad. Just not one that I should have been writing about...LOL The day before and the sleep I had going into yesterday set me up for it being a rough day. But it did end well. I found myself back to Zen Kitchen & Bar for some Asian dining. That has become my favorite local spot. Last night, they had live music. I really enjoy live music...hehehe That put me in a really good mood to finish off my day. Sadly, that good mood didn't provide me with the best sleep last night...LOL

I haven't been sleeping well lately. I think it has to do with my sinuses. But it could also be all of these personal emotions. There is a lot going on right now that I haven't written about. I've been spending a lot of time in prayer and in The Word trying to keep my head above water. Overall, I'm doing quite well, actually. My mood and attitude with everything going on has been really positive. I'm still going about my days as if nothing is going on. For a while, I think I was in denial that anything was bothering me. Perhaps some of these things are actually bothering me, though. If it is affecting my sleep, then yes, it is bothering me...hehehe

I'd like to finish my *Food for Thought* thread soon. I've sat down a few times to write it. But I've decided to wait until my frame of mind is clearer. I could always just throw it together and then refine it later if I ever do turn that entire thread into some sort of article or book chapter. Stuff like that in this journal are basically the initial, and very rough, draft of what they'd become in officially published form anyway...LOL This was just feels too important to write in my current emotional state. I'm not really doing bad. I just don't want my current state to cloud the message...hehehe I hope that makes sense? It's like, I'm doing okay. Just not great. So, I want to wait and give it my best shot when I'm doing great again...hehehe

And now I'm looking at another journal entry I won't be publishing. I'll go ahead and save it like I did yesterday. But this one will not go out on the site. When will I get to a point where I can write something I'm okay with sharing? If this site were truly just for me, then I suppose I wouldn't care what I wrote. But knowing that others do read this, I'm not comfortable with an entry like this one or the one from yesterday. Oh well...maybe tomorrow?
