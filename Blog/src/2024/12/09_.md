# TBD

In our Bible study last week, the first *Your Turn* question was *What new thing are you afraid Jesus might lead you to?* I had two answers. One was related to the possibility God might be calling me to start a church. The other was about me being alone. For nearly three years, I have lived alone. I've also had friends nearby come and go in that time. And at the moment, I have no friends nearby whatsoever.

For all but these recent years, I've always had someone. And for many of those years, I was taking care of people in some manner. So, these past few years have been quite an adjustment for me. There were a couple of times when loneliness set in and I was borderline depressed. When I wrote that part of my answer, it was in the spirit of being afraid that I was being lead to a life of solitude in so much as living with no one and having no one nearby to be around. God has given me the means to go to people; which I gladly do. I'm grateful for the privilege of having the resources to go to family and friends where they are.

I wrote that answer a week ago. Since then, I've been able to process it. Plus I was able to discuss it with Cherie yesterday in our fellowship time. That leads to me talking about it today...hehehe Writing it, meditating on it, and then discussing it has weakened my fear of it. The fear is still there. But the process the Bible study has taken me through this past week has led me to giving it over to God.

The main point of the message at theChapel last Wednesday was *Jesus only transforms what is transferred to Him.* I'll not rehash the full message, but my take away was that when I hold on to such things as my fear, I'm not allowing Jesus to transform it. For this particular fear, I'm in the process of transferring it to God. Being alone most of the time is something new for me. I honestly didn't know I was holding so tightly to this fear. Sometimes we need to be taken to a higher level of view to see such things from new perspectives.

Plus, bringing in an accountability partner can offer better perspectives. Cherie said a few things yesterday that sparked some new thoughts. She didn't tell me this, but I began thinking about it because of what she did say. I've chosen this life. I was running away from something when I moved to Florida. This circumstance is of my own doing. God has allowed it and He is teaching me things through it. But it isn't something that is happening *too* me. It's happening *because of* me. That's okay, by the way...hehehe

One of the things she said was that part of apartment living comes with people coming and going from our lives. Although I knew this, I hadn't really given it much thought until she said it. Having her perspective opened my mind wide open...hehehe I believe she was referring to my recent challenge of having made some new friends this year here at my complex who all moved at the same exact time...hehehe I'm glad she brought up the reality of people coming and going as part of the apartment lifestyle. That's what sparked my thoughts about how I chose this.

This doesn't always apply to my living the apartment life, though. If I had stayed in Indiana, I'd still have family and friends who would be relatively nearby. That's why I went down the path of this circumstance being of my own choosing. I wasn't called to move to Florida...LOL

A lot of wonderful things have happened because of my move here, though. So, I'll not allow this one fear to erase all of the blessings God has given me along this part of my path.
