## Welcome



## Behind the Curtain

For my entire life, I can be classified as a Christian. I was raised in the church. With the exception of a 6 year period, I've gone to church most of my life. Along the way I have strayed from the *path* a few times and have even looked into various other religions. But I've always been pointed back to following Jesus, the Christ. That said, I'd like to make one thing absolutely clear. I am not a religious person. For me, it is all about the relationship. Religion has had a negative connotation in my life. Whereas relationship draws out the positive. The former carries with it the burden of obligation. It signifies requirement over choice. The latter bears the burden for me through the sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. His sanctifying Grace draws me into a desire to know Him and a longing to Love as He does. I truly feel the condition of my heart far outweighs anything I am able to do. It sets the tone for the *why* I do anything.

*So, I was praying...* is a look *behind the curtain of a work in progress*. My progress. The reflections written on these pages are mine, and mine alone. Also included on these pages are a public domain Bible and a set of resources I've put together to help anyone who so desires to have a relationship with Jesus as well. Unless otherwise noted, the resources have come from my personal relationship with Jesus. As they guide me on my *path*, I too hope they can be a guide for you on your *path*. The reflection section is the exception. In that section, I include my personal reflection notes from devotionals I have engage in from other resources I've come across on this journey. Where I am able, I include links to those devotionals so you too can engage with them if you so choose.

## Bible

The version of the Word I include on this site is one that I'm actively working on as an exercise of my faith. I don't recommend it as a primary version for your own personal Bible study. The keyword here is *version*. It is not a translation. I am not a Bible scholar by any means. I'm simply working on providing a text that is in the public domain to reference here on this site. It is based on the [World English Bible](https://worldenglish.bible); which in turn is based on the American Standard Version. My preferred translations are the [New American Standard Bible](https://www.lockman.org/new-american-standard-bible-nasb/) and the [Amplified Bible](https://www.lockman.org/amplified-bible-amp/) by [The Lockman Foundation](https://www.lockman.org). They, too, were originally based on the American Standard Version. So, that's where I've decided to start as well.

But why another version? Again, it's simply an exercise of my own personal faith. I've read the entire Bible a few times in my lifetime. I've study commentaries and listened to countless sermons. I engage in devotionals and in depth Bible studies. But I wanted to go just one step further. By working on my own version of the Bible, I feel a more intimate connection with Jesus through His Word. My goal isn't to add to, take from, or otherwise misrepresent the Bible in any way. I remain true to the essence and original meaning of the Word. These are not *my* words in the text.

## Reflection

As part of my personal journey with Jesus, I engage in a number of devotionals and non-fiction books. In this section of the site, I provide my reflection notes. From time to time, I may go through a devotional or book again. I'll provide updates to my notes. I do a lot of thinking and a lot of writing. So I figured it would be fun to publish these notes on my site. Depending on how much you read through my notes, you may come across contradictory concepts or statements. That's okay. This can be considered a living site. Each time I write, I'm expressing my thoughts and feelings in the moment. I could write about the same topic multiple times and have new insight each time. Something I think or feel today may in fact be so different than how I thought or felt in the past that what I say *today* can be the complete opposite of what I said *yesterday*. I am human. I am growing. I am *a work in progress...making progress*.
