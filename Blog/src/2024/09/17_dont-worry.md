# Don't Worry

Today's lesson from *The Chosen* devotional (book 4, day 25) hits home for me. This isn't the first time these devotionals have talked about worry. But each time, they provide a different perspective. My handwritten journal for today was brief. As I reflected on the devotional, I decided I would keep those notes brief this time. I think I may have too much to say about it than what I could physically write on paper...LOL I hope to document more of my thoughts here in my online journal over time. It's far easier for me to type than to handwrite...hehehe

I've spent a good deal of my life worrying. One of my weaknesses has been imagining worst-case scenarios or dwelling on all the what-ifs that could happen. I play these scenarios out in my mind over and over. I start to see alternate scenarios spin off from those and it can go on and on. I've spiralled out of control a few times and had panic attacks. I spent years in and out of the hospital. And I've been on countless medications.

There are those in my life who do not suffer anxiety. They don't even worry, really. And they say things like *don't worry*, as if I can simply turn it off...LOL That can feel dismissive. I feel invalidated when I'm not shown compassion. I think that may be why I am so sensitive to others' anxieties, worries, doubts, concerns, and fears. I can listen to that all day long and I'll pray for them. I'll sometimes offer up some advice that has helped me. That can be tough sometimes, though. Sometimes, they just need someone to listen.

I no longer suffer these things now and I'm no longer being treated for any of it through professional help or medications. I still have worry, doubts, anxieties, concerns, and fear. They just no longer control me. They typically lead me to prayer now. But I stress that the *suffering* is gone. And those worst-case scenarios and what-ifs that play in my head no longer lead to running thoughts.

What changed in my life to allow me to overcome worry? The obvious answer is Jesus. However, how He did it isn't so obvious. And it isn't so easy to explain. I'm not going to be able to do it justice, really. I do my best to write some of my thoughts in hopes that it may help others. And I hope when I reread my journal someday, it will be good reminder. There are several journal entries that are related to this already. I often think and write about the various things God has taught me along my journey. *So, I was thinking...* is basically my telling of the story of the God who saved me...hehehe

Although there are some who say *don't worry*, the reality is there are more people telling us to worry than those telling us not to. A quick scroll on social media or a few minutes watching the news will reveal that so many are telling us what we *should* worry about. It also seems we will be judged if we don't worry about the things they worry about...LOL To make it worse, it seems people want us to dwell on our past and use that to be afraid of our future.

Facing my past has been a huge help in reducing worry and anxiety. For starters, nothing can change what happened. But I've learned that I can learn from it to change my future. I use to avoid triggers that reminded me of those events. Now I remind myself that I got through it. Also, I've realized that even when something happened more than once, that doesn't mean it will always happen again. Instead of being afraid of it happening again, I can simply pay attention to the signs of the potentials and look to God to redirect my path around repeating the past.

This actually takes a great deal of prayer. It also takes a great deal of focus on Jesus. Having fear isn't a lack of faith. It's simply a lack of focus. When I'm faced with a trigger now, I've trained my brain to go to prayer instead of the running thoughts that took me to panic.

With my focus on Jesus, it also helps me remember that God is my Provider.
