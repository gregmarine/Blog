# Ensō RGB (2021/11/01)

An [ensō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%25C5%258D) is a Zen-based artist's expression of painting a circle form in a single brushstroke which signifies the mind is free to allow the body to create. During those early days, I would often paint an ensō to give myself permission to be my authentic self. Being the technology enthusiast that I am, along with being an expressionist, I wanted to convey what I saw every day into a single painting.

Although it is a bit more complicated than this, all colors in the spectrum can be represented by 3 basic colors; red, green, and blue. Since the early days of color television, this has been the general case. I'm not going to dive deep into the other colors that go into this concept. However, for this painting, these 3 express my intentions.

When I look at this work, what I see is myself being given permission to fully create in my mind everything I have ever seen, what I am seeing in that moment, and everything I will ever see going forward. On a single 4 inch by 4 inch canvas, I can see my entire world without space or time.

Selah :pray:
