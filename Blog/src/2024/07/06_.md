# TBD

Today is an important day. Today is the day I get to spend a moment with my deer friend in person for the first time. We've known each other for a few years now having met on Twitter during the pandemic. Our mutual interest in Disney brought us together. She had shared a thought on Twitter that gained a lot of attention in the DisTwitter community. It caught my eye, and we became mutuals on that platform. We have since followed each other on various other social media platforms. But that is where it began.

She later commented on one of my posts about my paintings. That eventually inspired *Bambi's Bird*; which now adorns her book crate along with a second painting, *Bambi's Yawn, Thumper's Curiosity*. With the first painting, I included a note of encouragement along with my personal phone number to use anytime she needed to talk. A few months later, she reached out to me via text to encourage me. A true friendship has grown and blossomed ever since.

Over time, text messages went from once every few weeks to now, every few hours. We often share words of encouragement for one another or simply share random moments in our lives through photographs and videos. Sometimes it is beautiful and other times it's just us being silly. Each memory is cherished.

For the past 111 days, we have been in fellowship doing Bible devotionals. Today is our 112th and we get to do it together in person for the first time. Right now, we are in *The Chosen* book 2, day 32. These 111 days have been such a Blessing. I imagine today will be even more so.

I've met several people from my time on social media these last few years. I've learned to manage my expectations of the meetings. With this one, I've been really excited. There is something special about our friendship that I cannot put into any other words except to say it is a true friendship. I'm not anxious about this meeting whatsoever. I have an excited nervous energy about it. We've been talking over video calls for months now. With that, and the fact we text every day, today is almost like we are meeting up again. But we aren't.

This is really the first time. But because we talk all of the time, I really do not have any expectations. We were simply meant to meet today. God ordain this moment long before we even knew each other existed. I don't have any of those questions like: *Is she going to like me?* *Am I going to make a fool of myself?* *Will I stumble through conversations?* All I feel is that this is the next moment we get to share together.

I really hope she is feeling the same way this morning. The answer to the question *Is he going to like me?* is, I already do like you Ch√©rie. Or to the question *am I going to make a fool of myself?* is, nope! I know you are going to be yourself and I love you for that. And to *will I stumble through conversations?* I'd say, if that happens, we'll stumble together. Because that's the point...we are doing this together.

Our journeys in this life are separate. But from time to time, our journeys bring us along side special people.
