# Birthday Eve

I figure I should probably write a little tonight because I may not write anything tomorrow...hehehe Tomorrow is my BIRTHDAY!!!

I'm sure I wrote about this before, but I use to never celebrate my birthday. I hated to annual reminder that I was getting older. Not because of the *old* part. More like how adulting is hard work...hehehe I also didn't want to grow to become my dad! I love him dearly. But there is so much I don't want to be that he is...sorry dad!

Truth is, I'm not much like my dad. I'm more like my grandfather, his dad.
