Happy FriYAY!!! Go Dodgers!!! The 2024 World Series begins tonight in LA!!! Woohoo!!! They get to have their first victory of four in a row tonight...LOL j/k I have no idea how this series will play out. But I'm excited regardless...hehehe It's my first World Series in over 20 years! And it just happens that my new favorite team made it.

I'm wearing my LA shirt today and will drink from one of my LA coffee mugs today. No, doing so won't help the team win...LOL But it sure is fun! It's kind of like all the Disney mugs I use and the few Olaf t-shirts I have. In a way, it is support. It keeps me connected. Plus it is fun to talk to Cherie about the Dodgers. That's why I start rooting for them in the first place. It began as another way to connect with her.

It's another work day. I'm taking a quick break to start today's journal entry...hehehe I should have a pretty productive day. I have no meetings and my tasks are clear. It should be a good day to work a half day at home and half at Zen.

Speaking of Zen, I'm not sure if I'll be able to go tomorrow. I wanted to. But the town it is in is having a centennial celebration. If I do go, I may need to do a ride share into the area instead of driving myself. I doubt there will be much parking available. This will be the first time I've faced that issue since I've been going to Zen. I may ask about options while I'm there today.

I saw a graphic on Twitter that shows *Biblical traffic tomorrow here in LA* with all of the events going on tomorrow...hehehe They are having the World Series, a Lakers game, a USC game, something called the East LA Classic, and two concerts. Wow! If I lived there, I'd be staying home all day tomorrow...LOL

I find it funny how I hadn't given LA much thought most of my life. But this year, I think about it a lot. And having had my experiences there in July, LA now holds a special place in my heart. No, I don't want to live there...hehehe But it will always be special now. And I'll visit. My upcoming trip is to Santa Ana and Anaheim. So Orange County instead of LA County. I'm not sure I'd want to live there either. But it will be fun checking it out. I head there a week from tomorrow!!! So excited!!!

I keep thinking about my inner peace and how I view everything differently now. As I read through my past journal entries, I can see the path of growth I've traveled on my journey this year. To paraphrase what *Mary* said in season 1, episode 2 of *The Chosen*, before I was one way and now I am very different. What happened in between was Jesus. I've known of Jesus my entire life. And I first gave Him my heart 26 years ago. But I'd say I wasn't following Him until these past three years. Throughout this third year, I've experienced Him daily. God is so good!
