# TBD

A new week and a new month! Happy September! The beginning of the *ember* months...hehehe Many celebrate this as the end of summer and start of Fall. I do not. I see it as the last three weeks of summer...hehehe Even when I lived in Indiana, it still felt like summer until October. However, when I was kid, this was about the time when school started. So, I suppose there was a time when this week felt like summer was over...LOL

The only thing I left out of my journal entries about my North Carolina trip was how I dropped by Disney World on my way home. Since I drove, and Orlando was on the way home, I thought it would be nice to end the trip there. Also, it looked like I would be arriving in the area around dinner time. Perfect timing, if you ask me...hehehe I arrived shortly after a storm had passed and was greeted with a rainbow as I entered the parking lot of EPCOT.

I decided to have dinner at the Rose & Crown in the UK pavilion. This was my first time experiencing this one. I rarely do the table service restaurants at EPCOT. The many festivals they have keep my stomach full with all of the food booths. In the *off season* without festivals, I like to give the tables service places a try. I really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and even the price.

I believe it is one of those restaurants not run by Disney themselves. I think most of the EPCOT table services are run by companies from their respective countries. Of course, the feel of cost is relative to the one paying...hehehe What isn't expensive to me might be expensive to someone else. Then again, most people throw away their thoughts on cost while they are at Disney. They know going in that it isn't cheap. Disney *magic* allows people to ignore the numbers...until they get home and see the ledger...LOL

The rest of the evening was pleasant. I walked around a bit. I also had a small bite to eat in the Japan pavilion. I always love their food and couldn't pass up the opportunity to enjoy it again...hehehe I enjoyed some people watching and overall ambience of EPCOT. It is my favorite park, after all.
