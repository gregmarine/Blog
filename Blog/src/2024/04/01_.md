# TBD

I'm dealing with sadness today. Normally I wouldn't talk about it. Especially here. I typically draw back into seclusion until it passes. But today, I decided I should talk it out. I'm learning that talking about how I feel seems to help get me through it. Writing in this journal this year has been very helpful. So, let's give this a try, shall we...hehehe

It began on Saturday. I can't really point my finger at anything and identify it as the source of my sadness. I just feel sad. I nearly canceled my plans to go to church yesterday. I was asked to help save someone a seat. He had surgery on his knee last week and knew he wouldn't be able to get to where he wanted to sit quickly. So I volunteered to get to the front row and save him a seat so he could go at his pace getting up there. I didn't want to back out of that just because I was sad. So that's why I went to church yesterday.

Other than that, I wasn't feeling church. In a way, I wish I hadn't gone. I didn't feel this way about tuning into the CCGS stream, though. That experience was a Blessing. I went to a wilderness preserve nearby and watched the service with my windows rolled down. Having the sounds of nature and a nice breeze made for a perfect spiritual moment while I listened to the message. Also, when I arrived at the preserve, I came across some deer eating grass on the side of the road. That was so peaceful. I'm definitely glad God brought me there to see that.

After the CCGS service concluded, I drove to Tarpon Springs to have brunch with friends. It was great seeing them and the food was fantastic. But there was a bad energy there; which is difficult to explain in words. It drained my social battery and I ended up going home after that and took a nap. My sister had invited me to visit with her and her future in-laws. But I just couldn't do it. I feel bad about that. I know myself well enough to know that I would have made myself worse had I gone, though.
