## God's Temple (My Body)

Taking care of my body is an act of worship

With my new sleep schedule, I have been experimenting with my time management. One such experiment is in regards to my workout schedule. Whether it be my strength and core training or my walking or running routines, it is difficult to settle on a nice pattern in the Winter months in Florida.

Today, I did day 3 of my strength and core training. I achieve this workout Monday, Wednesday, and today, Friday. I've been doing it in the morning as I have managed to wake up by 5am every day this week. Today, I added some core exercises that also help with back pain caused by working a desk job. I have a standing desk. But that isn't enough to overcome years of back torture...hehehe

While I was doing this new core training, I got to thinking about how I was doing my workout during those first 3 hours of the day before work. Today marks 111 days I have started my day with God. Giving Him the first part of my day has been more than a game changer. It has been LIFE changing.

As I was working on my physical health, I realized I was taking care of God's temple. The body is considered a temple of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, taking care of my body is actually an act of worship. Doing a workout in those early hours of the are like continuing to give God the first fruits of my day. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 states,

> Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.

Although that follows the context of sexual sin, I believe it also applies to exercise and diet. In 2005, I attempted to take my own life. I literally wanted to die at the age of 27. The years following that I didn't want to live into my 40s. As I entered my 40s, I no longer wanted to die. However, I felt like I was actually dying. In 2023, as I was going from 44 to 45 years of age, I started working on my physical health. The months that followed proved that I was in fact not dying! Now, well, I want to live until I'm 135 and beyond! Isn't God amazing?!? I'm going to continue to take good care of His temple, my body, until I'm at least 135. Just you wait and see!

## New Face

I have had either a VanDike, goatee with a mustache, or beard most of my adult life. When I first grew out my facial hair, it was out of laziness. Shaving every day, or every other day, was a chore. Who wants a chore that often?!? Truth is, there are always daily chores. But I had plenty in my life that shaving just wasn't a priority...hehehe So, laziness settled in pretty easily.

As I gain weight in my 20s, my beard became a way to hide my obesity. My neck and large cheeks were easy to hide behind hair. In my 30s, I even had a season when I allowed my head hair to grow to hide the fat bludge on the back of my neck. At least in my mind, my hair is what people's eyes were fixed on when they looked at my face and head.

With the extreme weight loss of 70 lbs over the last 12 months, I thought I'd give a fresh smooth shaven look a try. At first, I was like, WHOA! It was quite a shock. It had been so long since I had ever shaved my face completely. For a day or so, I wasn't sure I liked it and thought I'd immediately allow my pepper beard to grow back. This morning, however, I decided to continue to shave my face for the time being. So, I give you my new face!

## Tragedy in Paradise

My version of Paradise on Earth is Florida. I've vacation in Florida as far back as my memory will go! Even as an adult, I loved vacationing in Florida. It wasn't much of a surprise to anyone that I decided to move here. Most people expected me to move to Orlando due to my love of all things Disney. But Disney is such a small part of what I love about Florida. In fact, Disney is a bit on the nose, actually.

Besides the obvious Disney connection, I love the climate here! The weather is my type of weather. Rainy, windy, stormy, and sunny all in the same day! The key being that it is sunny most of the time...hehehe And the hurricanes are no bother. There is more than plenty of warning. Nothing like the tornadoes from the midwest and that occasional earthquake. Neither of those had any warning whatsoever! I also love the wildlife here! It is literally my idea of paradise.

Paradise is not always as such, however. Not everything is perfect here. The bad stuff can still happen. When I sent a text to my friend Dan this morning tell him to have a fantastic day, he replied that it hadn't started out so fantastic. Dan is amazing person and a teacher in a local community here in Florida. Today, his school got the news that one of his students had tragically passed away in a house fire last night. I cannot imagine what he, the students, or the community are feeling today. My heart and prayers go out to them!

## Run, Greg, Run!

No matter how the day was going, whether it was tragedy in paradise or whatever was happening at work, I just had to run at lunch today! I actually ran in lieu of eating today. That's just how important it was that I go outside and ran!

I set out to run 2 miles today. I had a time constraint and didn't feel I could get in much more than 2 in the time I had. As I began to run, I turned on today's "Bible in a Year" plan so it could be read to me as I ran. That turned out to be quite the motivator. I typically only listen to music when I run. Listening to the Bible turned out to be really nice! Today, it was Genesis 22, 23, and 24. After that, it was back to music!

After my run today, I had an alert from my Apple Health app. Before my health journey, such alerts were about warning signs that I was "dying!" Now, these alerts are more about how I have been improving. Today's?!? Yep, it was a sign of improvement! Back in December 2021, I received an alert that my Cardio Fitness was dangerously low after experiencing a roller coaster at Universal Studios Orlando. In December 2022, I could not even ride that roller coaster. Beginning in 2023, I started my health journey. Today, I got an alert that the same Cardio Fitness I was warned about in 2021 had improved from 26.9 to 34.1! I'm only a few points from being in the "normal" range for that metric!

Although I only ran 2 miles today, I pushed harder than I have ever pushed. I knew I was only running 2 miles. So I didn't need to pace myself for any farther. After my run, and with that positive alert, I realize I need to keep pushing. Not for distance, but for faster shorter distances. I need to push harder for a single mile until I can run all miles at these faster paces. I'm not racing against others. I'm racing for better health!
