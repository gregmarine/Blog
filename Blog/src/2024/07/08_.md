# TBD

It's travel day once again...hehehe This time, I'm headed home from my visit to California. I'll be waiting at a few airports today. The one in Ontario, California. And then again in Las Vegas, Nevada. I'm going to use the wait time to reflect and write about my experience. Right now, I'm sitting at an airport restaurant in Ontario. I didn't eat at airport restaurants on my way here. I typically do eat. I'm not really sure why I didn't last week...hehehe Today I'm mostly doing so to have a place to write. It's easier with a table...hehehe It also helps me avoid some of the crowds since only restaurant guests are in the restaurant...LOL I just wish it wasn't so loud (in the whole airport...not just the restaurant area). I'd wear my headphones except I want to be aware of people around me. Not that I think someone would steal any of my stuff while I wasn't looking. After all, everyone here is paying to be here and no one wants their stuff taken. But being aware of those around you is just plain smart.

Now that I don't drink alcohol, I keep asking restaurants if they have non-alcoholic beer. Back home, everywhere has them. Here in California, they keep looking at me like they have never heard of such a thing...LOL They are like, *sir, you know you are sitting at a bar, right?!?* Or even when I'm not sitting at the bar, they are like *sir, you know alcohol is awesome, right!?!* The only place I was able to get some was at the chain restaurant I went to on Thursday...hehehe I only went there because it was the holiday and the local restaurant I wanted to check out was closed for the holiday...LOL Oh well, perhaps someday I'll stop asking. It's just that I don't typically like tap water and I don't drink sodas anymore. I'll sometimes order tea. But that isn't any better than soda when it's that fountain junk. I'll sometimes drink soda too. But that stuff just doesn't make me feel right anymore. Non-alcoholic beer doesn't have that affect on me, though. I feel fine with it. And I do love the taste...hehehe Coffee does the trick in a pinch. But I don't need the caffeine. I only like drinking that at home as more of a meditative thing. I may switch that to teas soon. I drink tea sometimes...perhaps that will become more of a regular thing soon. Wow...I just talked a lot about drinks...hehehe

As I reflect on the experiences I just had, I'm feeling so much joy. I really needed this trip. I didn't realize how much I needed it. And God Blessed me in ways that I didn't even expect, ask for, or imagine could have happened. The time on the mountainside, seeing the Pacific Ocean for the first time, spending a day with my deerest friend, and 4 hours of prayer, meditation, and scripture at the arboretum were all beyond words. The only thing I knew would happen was spending time with ChÃ©rie. But what happened that day was unexpected. She just texted me to remind me of Peggy...hehehe ðŸ¤­ Peggy was a peg-legged pigeon we met at Union Station on Saturday...LOL See, that was something I just didn't expect to experience on this trip. It's moments like that which make my life so wonderful.

Something I believe I forgot to mention Saturday was how we were joking with each other about how *The Last Bookstore* could have been the...laaaaast...bookstore we'd ever visit...bwhahaha That part of the city was a bit shady. I think I mentioned something about that. But we had some fun later on joking about it being the last bookstore we'd ever see...hehehe I did my golden age of Hollywood voice and said, *this will be the last bookstore...seeeeee You'll never make it out alive...seeeeee* ðŸ¤­

It's difficult to pick just one moment to say it was my favorite. Even when I wrote about my favorite moment from Saturday, I felt like I was cheating on the other moments that day...hehehe Every moment was my favorite...hehehe I suppose to some that means none of my moments were a favorite. That's not how I feel. I feel as though each moment has value. I still find it important to reflect each day and find my favorite moment of the day. That exercise keeps my days going in my mind. But I honestly do find value in all moments. So, when I ask someone what their favorite moment is, I'm really just asking them to reflect on their day. That's what I do. And I love it!
