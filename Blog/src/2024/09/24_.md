# TBD

Yesterday was quite a day. It all began when I woke up early. As I was waking, I was like, *God, do you want me to get up now? It's a little early, isn't it!?* LOL I read through yesterday's devotional and was very confused. I read it a second time and began journaling. But then my journal notes didn't make any sense to me either. I decided to set that all aside and prepare for my morning prayer walk. As I was going about my prayer walk, confusion set in even more. I began to ponder if perhaps I wasn't ready to know what God was trying to tell me through yesterday's devotional. Would this be something future *me* would need to revisit someday?

Throughout the remainder of the main portion of the day, I reread the devotional an additional five or so times. Each time, praying for discernment and understanding. About 13 hours after I first read it, I finally understood what God might have been trying to tell me through it. Funny thing, though, my journal notes do not fully reflect what I think I learned throughout the day...LOL Sometimes, I write that journal at a very high level of what I understand. Part of that could be that I'm handwriting it. When I type out a journal, like I do here, I don't typically limit myself. With handwritten journaling, I tend to limit myself for various reasons. I suppose that might be due to how difficult writing by hand can get over time and how paper is a finite resource. Typing doesn't cause my hands to cramp up and the digital space my documents take up is quite minimal...hehehe

I've decided not to fully journal what all I learned yesterday. Some things are best kept on the tablet of my heart. Some of what I get from the Spirit is meant just for me and not to be shared with others. I think that is the way it is for everyone who follows Christ. Not everything He shared with the likes of Peter, James, John, and the other disciples were shared with all of the others. Some things were simply meant for the individual. I even imagine there were things He told each of them that were never written down to be included in the Bible. For the three years of His ministry, the Gospels are pretty short...LOL

The work portion of my day was pretty normal. I had a few meetings. So, nothing out of the ordinary with work. I'm glad for that. It hasn't been stressful. And I do like my work. Not everyone can say that. Happiness may be a choice. But it also helps to be doing things that make that an easy choice...LOL I haven't always had this in my jobs. I'm grateful for the opportunities God has in front of me with this job right now. This has been a good season with my job. I say this in spite of all the uncertainties there have been with work this year.

With my walks and a jog yesterday, I did just shy of a 10k for the day. I did six miles total of exercise. Combine that with my normal activity of walking around my apartment, I went 7.62 miles at 14,676 steps for the entire day...LOL I also burned nearly 3k calories. It feels great to be so active. I still remember the days when I could barely walk from my apartment to the car without feeling fatigue. For my evening walk and jog, I actually jogged 5k of it this time. That is 3.1 miles as opposed to just the one mile I had jogged each day Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I did a final one mile walk to cool down. But even with that cool down mile, I ended it with sprinting back and forth along the fence row of the Bark Park with Lavender...LOL That's right! I sprinted several paces after I had already run a 5k! I say again with emphasis...I *sprinted* several paces back and forth along a fence row with a dog *after* I had already run a full 5k!!! And that 5k was one of my fastest to date...LOL

After all the sprinting...hehehe...I asked Autumn if I could sit with her for a bit. After all, I had just run a 5k and sprinted several paces...LOL Ooh! Did I mention that already...LOL j/k She was glad for me to join her for a chat. As we began talking I had told her about how my health was in January last year. I told her God had carried me through this amazing health journey since. A few topics later, she asked me about how I mentioned God. As it turns out, she too is a Christian. So we talked about that for a bit. She told me that she was wondering if I was a Christ follower ever since I first started interacting with her dog because she could see Jesus in how I treated others here in our community. She and others had observed how I try to talk to everyone I come across as I walk. Apparently, Jesus has been shining through me and I didn't realize it.
