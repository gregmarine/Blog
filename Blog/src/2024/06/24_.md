# TBD

I was a little sad over the weekend. Nothing to be concerned about. In general, I'm still quite happy. It was just a feeling of sadness that kept me thinking. I suppose I've actually been a bit sad for a bit. I've been quiet sometimes. I've been holding back a bit too. Again, nothing to worry about, really. Last night I got to thinking...I'm just tired. I'm physically, mentally, and spiritually worn.

This month, I've taken a break from my typical lifestyle. I haven't gone out and done much. I haven't even been to Disney in a month. I have only eaten out once in the past month or so. I did take myself to a movie and I went out for some ice cream. Those were very much needed distractions in those moments. I suppose in a way, I've been preparing myself for my upcoming trip to California.

I was talking with my parents last night about how I think I'll be going back to my regular lifestyle after that trip. When I return from California, I'm likely going to go to Disney, maybe the beach, and perhaps get back out on the water. I've not done any of that is so long. Then again, I may not do any of that when I return...hehehe Some things I feel like a need to plan. Other things really do not need planning.

I think one of the things that has been making me sad is my *church situation*. Yesterday, I decided it was time for me to leave theChapel. Now I have to decide how to handle that. I don't feel obligated to *announce* it or anything. By handle, I really mean how do I answer people who ask me about it. And how do I handle their reaction. I shouldn't care what people think about what I need to do with my life. But I do care how it affects them. I have friends there that could be impacted by this decision. Do I tell them now? Or do I simply wait and see if they reacted to it.
