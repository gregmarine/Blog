# TBD

Back in January, I wrote in this journal every day for 3 weeks during my prayer and fasting that I did with my church. It was basically the official kickoff for this new blog site. About a month ago, I wrote most days in the timestamp format. In between and recently, I've just journaled as I was inspired. I can safely say that I absolute love writing. Sometimes I like to write in a more formal fashion. Sometimes I like to simply jot my thoughts. No matter what style I use, or for what purpose, I really enjoy writing...hehehe

I may spend the weekend working on some of my projects. I won't likely get very far. But progress is progress, right?! hehehe I've decided not to make any goals. I'll just do whatever feels right and see what comes of it all. I don't want to lose any of the passion by turning it into work, you know? One of the tasks I'd really like to tackle and accomplish this weekend is finishing up the setup of a few of my other sites. They are all linked to my *bygregmarine* domain. But I like to separate the contexts into subdomains. Such as this blog being under *blog.bygregmarine.com* and my art being at [*art.by.gregmarine.com*](https://art.bygregmarine.com). Both of these sites look and feel the same. However, the content is set in the context of their respective purposes and have an appropriate menu to navigate said content. It is sort of like how my brain works. I compartmentalize my life in almost ever aspect.
