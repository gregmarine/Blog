# TBD

Three days into the new year and I've journaled each day. Will I journal every day this year? I don't know. It wasn't one of my resolutions...LOL But it was a goal, like last year, to journal as often as inspired.

Although I am not putting timestamps to this, I have been writing throughout the day these last few days. That would be why I sometimes jump to a completely different topic suddenly...hehehe

After my morning prayer, I took a walk. I had missed getting outside so early in the morning. Well, not so early. But before work. I don't recall the last time I took my first walk before work. I was able to see what I call the sunrise. It technically isn't the actual sunrise because there are too many things around here to block it. But just as the sun is rising above the nearby mall, I see a beautiful sight. It was great to see that today. It had been far too long.

I feel completely different now than I did on Tuesday. It is as if the new year started was a switched that got flipped. I'm not sure I can explain it well today. But perhaps, as the year progresses, my journal will reflect what I feel. Of course, things rarely happen overnight. It is actually something that had begun after my California trip in November. But ringing in the new year has made a noticeable change in my spirit. It was as if all that happened between November 10th and December 31st was preparing me for January 1st, 2025.

In a way, I have been training myself for things like this for quite a while. A few years ago, I had gotten tired of messing up the year when I wrote out dates on things. To fix that, I would start using the next year's numbered year for certain things. I would still use the current year when applying actual dates to things. But I would use the next year for random stuff. What would then happen is I would use the correct year on January 1st. Once again, that worked this year...hehehe

These past few years, I've been doing something similar going into each new year. If I had some goals for the new year, I would actually begin working on them the last quarter of the current year. The 2023 into 2024 example would be how I start my day with God. I began that in October 2023. That has now continued to this day. Going from 2024 into this year, one of my major goals was to eat at home more often and to wash my dishes by hand most of the time. I began that process in November and it has now continued into 2025. So far, so good...LOL
