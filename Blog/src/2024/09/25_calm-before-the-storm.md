# Calm Before the Storm

I normally title my journal entries after I've written them. That is typically so that I can title them with the main highlights of what we're about to read together...hehehe Today's title came before I wrote the entry. It is aptly named because Hurricane Helene is lurking out in the Gulf of Mexico. That's right! The tropical storm I mentioned yesterday is definitely a hurricane. It's predicted strength keeps increasing too. As of this writing, it is only a category 1. However, they are starting to predict it may become a category 4 before it makes landfall. Considering the original prediction was only a category 2 level, I'm guessing it could potentially be a category 5 by the time it actually does make landfall.

As the title suggests, I'm sitting in the calm before the storm. I mentioned yesterday I was bugging out to Disney. I left home around 2pm and arrived here around 4:15pm. The weather permitted me to make a quick trip to EPCOT for the evening to have some festival food, enjoy a ride in Mexico on the Grand Fiesta Tour attraction, and take in one of the concerts from the *Eat to the Beat* concert series. This included one lap around the World Showcase...about a mile in length. Overall, it was quite the enjoyable evening <3

There have been a few moments when I felt bad for coming to Disney when so many people are staying put back home. But this is my life and that is theirs. I was given this opportunity as a gift and I shouldn't feel bad for it. I'm learning to live my life as I'm suppose to live it. If that includes the ability to escape a storm by going to Disney, that should be okay, right?! I could have gone to a different hotel. But why? There really isn't anything wrong with coming to Disney if I have to stay in a hotel anyway. No one is making me feel guilty for this. It was just something in the back of my mind this week.

My family is thrilled I left the gulf coast well before the impact of the storm begins. I don't always leave. But this storm is quite different from others I've experienced. I didn't hesitate to make my plans to leave. And I do feel Blessed to be able to afford Disney. Plus, Disney is one of the safest places to be in Florida. They are well equipped to weather hurricanes. Whether or not they planned that from the beginning, I do not know. But they are at least that way now...LOL

Something else that happened today was my phone call with Pastor Doug.
