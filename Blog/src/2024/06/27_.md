# TBD

I overslept today...HAHAHA It was weird. My alarm went off and I acknowledged it. I have to in order to turn it off. But I fell right back to sleep. And then my white noise app must have turned off on its own. But that didn't wake me up either...hehehe When I finally woke up, it was almost time to start work...LOL I suppose my body really needed that extra time! I almost never sleep that deeply...HA!

After that, I felt a little goofy; which inspired my morning post. It also inspired a few silly videos. I sent one of them to my deer friend. The funny thing about today is that in the past, oversleeping would have caused me to panic and feel rushed to get going. That wasn't at all the case today. I don't know what my favorite moment will be today. But waking up feeling peace despite having overslept is definitely a top tier moment today <3

Last night, my sister asked me if I had decided on all the places I was going to visit in California next week...hehehe I told her what I'll be doing is still evolving...LOL I guess it has been a very long time since I've taken a real trip. Have I forgotten the protocol?!? You go somewhere and you plan everything ahead of time, right!?! Nope, not me...hehehe I think most of what I'll be doing there will be spontaneous. The fact that I'm doing anywhere is exciting enough...hehehe

As of now, the only plan that seems to be coming together is a visit to [The Last Bookstore](https://www.lastbookstorela.com) in LA on Saturday. I may also visit Little Tokyo that day while I'm in the area. I don't plan on driving into LA. So I'll take transportation in. I'd like to get to Union Station as part of that adventure. Taking the trains as part of this will be something new for me. I'll be doing these things with Chérie. So it will all be amazing. Sharing these experiences will be cherished memories for the rest of my life <3

Originally, we were going to do the arboretum. Then we added another day to also go to Color Me Mine and do the farmer's market. Then it became The Last Bookstore and possibly Little Tokyo. What I love about all of these ideas is I'll have plenty of time do it all even though she isn't able to join me for everything. All are great ideas and I can choose to do some of them on my own or not at all. I love the fact that I can just let these moments happen on their own. That's going to make this vacation feel relaxing.

The trip keeps evolving as the time draws near. Partly because I now know what the weather is forecast to be. But also because of some wonderful news! Chérie got promoted at work! Yay!!! My heart is incredibly happy for her! She seemed to feel bad about needing to reduce our time together. But I am way too excited for her new opportunity to be concerned about that at all. I am so proud of her. This past year of her journey has been so inspiring. To say my heart is happy is a great understatement. Understanding her past and seeing her future bloom makes today such a blessing. I'm grateful to get to see her story unfold. And I'm grateful for the moments I get to be a part of it. I'm going to cherish our time together on this trip.

I didn't really want to travel much in the summer. The weather is predictably unpredictable...hehehe But here's the thing, I wanted to go to California for my birthday in March this year. I lost all hope in that when my company announced our work was being outsourced. I canceled all pending plans for travel as a result. As the time went on, I realized I need to just keep living me life regardless of what my company was doing...LOL Since California was still on my mind, I decided I didn't care that summer isn't the best time to be there. I'm ready to make memories! Time-wise, the July 4th holiday was the perfect time for the trip. That's why I'm doing it. What I will be doing isn't important. Just doing it is what matters to me.

I can imagine some people may think I'm a little crazy or stupid for going just for going's sake. I just don't see it that way. For one, I get to see my friend. That in and of itself makes it all worth doing...hehehe And there's the fact that this is my first real trip in 3 years. Thanks to Facebook memories, I now remember it has been exactly 3 years. This day 3 years ago was my first day of my last vacation...LOL And I mean traveling vacation. I'm not counting taking time off since I've moved here to do staycations or my travels back to Indiana to visit friends and family.
