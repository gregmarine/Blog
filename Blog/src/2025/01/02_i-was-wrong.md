# I Was Wrong

I sure am tired today...LOL It is weird how much more worn out I am today than I was yesterday. The night before was New Year's when I stayed up late and got poor sleep into yesterday. I was tire, sure. But I made it through the day. Today, after 7 and half hours of sleep, I have been dragging all day long...LOL

I suppose part of this isn't physical. I'm also emotionally and mental exhausted. I have those times when I need to rest my entire being. Perhaps that time is coming again. November and December were amazing. A lot happened. I think maybe it is catching up with me. But then again, I faced something similar going into those months if I recall correctly. I haven't gone back to my journal to see exactly when it happened last. But it doesn't feel like it was that long ago...hehehe

These are just thoughts right now, though. I'm not the least bit concerned about it. I don't have a lot going on this month. So I'll find plenty of rest. These are just words and those are just feelings. God always helps me find the balance <3

There are some 3 word sentences that are very impactful. *I love you*, *I am sorry*, *I am here*, *I don't know*, and *I was wrong*. The last one, *I was wrong*, is on my mind today. I've been around long enough to have been wrong about a great many things...LOL Admitting it isn't always easy. But it is very freeing.

There isn't anything particular on my mind today that I was wrong about. A lot of things float around in my head sometimes. Today is one of those days when I realize I have been wrong quite a bit in my life. In some ways, I feel like I have never been right...about anything...LOL

I wonder how many of us are wrong about certain things and either carry on with ignorance of it or with pride and ignore it? I can think of times in my life when I have been guilty of both. I don't like to be ignorant or prideful. When I find out I'm wrong, I want to do something about it. If it is just knowledge, I'll seek it and the understanding of it to correct my thinking. If it is an action, I want to correct the mistake or make up for it somehow.
