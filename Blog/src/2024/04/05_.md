A week ago on Good Friday, my employer allowed us all to leave work around 1pm for an early dismal to celebrate the Easter weekend. I honestly wasn't expecting it and it was a very welcome surprise. With the extra 4 hours I was gifted, I decided to visit the *Nature Coast Botanical Gardens* in Spring Hill, Florida.

One of my favorite moments from that experience was the red-bellied woodpecker in the above photograph. I spent about 5 minutes enjoying this beautiful creation working on building some homes in the tree. I took several photographs by which to remember the moment through. As I was reviewing them this morning, I was inspired to write the haiku.

I cherish moments like these. It was simple. It was beautiful. And God has given me the ability to capture such moments through a lens. In this particular photograph, I shot through some leaves in the foreground. It was as if I was peering through into a secret place and watching God provide just what this creature needed to sustain its existence.
