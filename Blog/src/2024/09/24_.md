# TBD

Yesterday was quite a day. It all began when I woke up early. As I was waking, I was like, *God, do you want me to get up now? It's a little early, isn't it!?* LOL I read through yesterday's devotional and was very confused. I read it a second time and began journaling. But then my journal notes didn't make any sense to me either. I decided to set that all aside and prepare for my morning prayer walk. As I was going about my prayer walk, confusion set in even more so. I began to ponder if perhaps I wasn't ready to know what God was trying to tell me through yesterday's devotional. Would this be something future *me* would need to revisit someday?

Throughout the remainder of the main portion of the day, I reread the devotional an additional five or so times. Each time, praying for discernment and understanding. About 13 hours after I first read it, I finally understood what God was trying to tell me through it. Funny thing, though, my journal notes do not fully reflect what I learned throughout the day...LOL Sometimes, I write that journal at a very high level of what I understand. Part of that could be that I'm handwriting it. When I type out a journal, like I do here, I don't typically limit myself. With handwritten journaling, I tend to limit myself for various reasons. I suppose that might be due to how difficult writing by hand can get over time and how paper is a finite resource. Typing doesn't cause my hands to cramp up and the digital space my documents take up is quite minimal...hehehe

I've decided not to fully journal what all I learned yesterday. Some things are best kept on the tablet of my heart. Some of what I get from the Spirit is meant just for me and not to be shared with others. I think that is the way it is for everyone who follows Christ. Not everything He shared with the likes of Peter, James, John, and the other disciples were shared with all of the others. Some things were simply meant for the individual. I even imagine there were things He told each of them that were never written down to be included in the Bible. For the three years of His ministry, the Gospels are pretty short...LOL
