## First Shop Visit

On Saturday, I took my car in for its first shop visit since I purchased it last September. It was well overdue for a checkup as I've already put on about 6-10k miles on it. 2 of those thousand were for my trip back to Indiana back in December...hehehe I probably should have take it in before that trip. I think I had already put on 5k by then. I drive a lot more than I thought I would!

Having a car is a necessary evil where I live. Nothing of importance is anywhere near me. I originally moved to my current location because my sister and her husband lived nearby. After they divorced, he moved away and excommunicated me and my sister moved about 45 minutes south of me. Nothing else I enjoy is anywhere near. I even have a 20-25 minute drive just to get to church. I've thought about moving closer to the church. But that is still at least another year away.

The initial assessment was that the car is still in fantastic condition. They only recommended the usual stuff based on the mileage of the car. I went ahead and agreed to all of it so those things would be good for another 30k miles. It was a bit more expensive that I would have liked. But then again, it was all maintenance that will prevent other issues that would cost a lot more. I have experience in lettings cars without necessary maintenance and that has cost me far more than I'd care to admit...hehehe

Back to this being a necessary evil, I often wonder what it would be like to live in an apartment that is within walking distance of everything important. I've even looked into places in the few cities I wouldn't mind living in that are close to the grocery and some social places I think I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, Florida isn't train friendly. The few places where a train can take me to places like Disney aren't the sort of cities I would want to live in. There is talk about a train line coming between Tampa and Orlando. But that isn't set in stone yet.

That said, I'm not really a city boy. My heart belongs to the countryside. I even owned a home out in the middle of nowhere once. I miss that lifestyle. If I stay in Florida, it would be nice to purchase some acreage and put a simple house where I can grow some of my own food and have a garden would be great. But it probably won't happen. So I need to find the least objectionable living space...LOL I just don't think it will ever be a space where I won't need a car...HAHAHA

One of the benefits of that trip to the shop was that I was able to work about 3 hours on my book. When the service manager asked me what I was up to, I mentioned I was working on a book. Although his initial interest in what I was doing was likely just surface level, he seemed a bit surprised at my response. So, he inquired more about the project. It was a pleasant conversation which led to talking about how he has been working on overcoming some issues from his own past. WOW! He hasn't even read my book and it has already gotten him to think about all that he has already overcome. That's pretty awesome!

## Tarpon Springs

After that time at the shop, and a quick bathroom break at home, I decided to make what I thought would be a quick trip to Tarpon Springs. I had thought about going the night before. But I ended up just getting a frozen pizza and watched the Dodgers game...hehehe There is a restaurant there I really love named Rusty Bellies. And there are a few shops I wanted to visit at the sponge docks.

I drove down the sponge docks only to find a Disney level crowd...hehehe It turned out they were having one of their *wine walks* where one pays a small fee to get 25 one ounce pours of wine at the various shops there. It is a way to get people to visit all of the shops. I've participated in one of those wine walks before. It was great and I did end up becoming a patron of several of those shops. But not that night! It was way too crowded for me. I do love people. But those crowd levels trigger my anxiety.

I ended up driving down some roads I had never been on just to get away from the excitement going on at the sponge docks. In doing so, I ended up parking in a lot I hadn't been at before. I parked and got out to walk to another local restaurant I had been to before. I arrived there a little before they opened. However, they checked and they were booked for the evening. They didn't have room for little old me...hehehe

2 strikes! At this point, I actually almost cried. I do mean that literally. I was having a spike in my anxiety level and all I really wanted was to go somewhere familiar. I was hungry and didn't want to drive somewhere else to find a familiar spot. I started to walk away and head back to my car. I spoke a simple prayer to the effect of, "God, you brought me to this moment...where should I go?" As I was approaching the corner where I would have turned to go back to my car, there was this little restaurant named Currents. I had never been there and honestly hadn't noticed it was there before...LOL

I stepped in and immediately noticed it to be quite a fancy little place. Everyone there appeared to be well dressed and there I was in jeans. I had a nice shirt on. But I still felt under dressed. Normally I would have just turned around and walked away in shame. Yes, I sometimes feel that way. But this time, I was like, "God brought me here for a reason...I'm moving forward!" I walked up to the bar and sat. The tender greeted me and I began to feel a bit better. He asked if I was there to drink, eat, or both. I replied both.

I then proceeded to ask him if it was okay if I were to get out by iPad and do some writing. I felt that my productivity from that morning could continue while I was there. He gave me the most serious look and said that I would not be allowed to work on my book. My spirit sank for a moment. Then he quickly laughed and told me it was absolutely no problem. He was just being sarcastic...hehehe Just like the service manager earlier in the day, he inquired into more about my project. Which was nice! I've never really openly discussed my book outside of my closest friends.

Dinner was nice and my experience at Currents was pleasant. I'll definitely be going back. I love to support the local small businesses. Aside from the pleasant atmosphere and fine dining, my time writing was not as productive. I did write a lot. But I think most of it will go into the digital *trashcan*...hehehe The essence of what I was trying to say just wasn't there. I might be able to tweak it later. For now, it is safe in my version control system...meaning there is a draft saved perpetually.

## Olaf Trifecta

When I woke up Sunday, I wasn't planning to go to Disney. I went about my morning like I do every single day. When I prayed asking God "what are we doing to do today?", an overwhelming desire to go to Disney ensued. And I mean far stronger than any other time I've wanted to go...hehehe I opened the app to find that Hollywood Studios as available along with a lunch time reservation to the Sci-Fi Dine-In theatre restaurant. The only problem was that it would mean I would need to skip church.

Something didn't feel right about that, so I tested it. I evaluated what it would mean to grab that reservation and skip church. Along with an opportunity to see the Fantastmic show that night. That's when I noticed the show was going to be at 9:30pm. The often have an earlier show around 8pm. But for some reason they didn't have that show time that night. Only the 9:30pm showing. I really wanted to see that show but didn't want to leave as late as when I would if I stayed for that show. That was the answer I needed. I feel like I'm leaving so details out about how I connected this to my test, but it really was the answer...LOL

So what I ended up doing was make a dinner reservation for Sci-Fi around 8pm but one that didn't include the Fantasmic show. I proceeded to go to church and then I drove to Disney after. I'm glad I went to church. It was a fantastic service and I was able to see Kerry. I hadn't seen him in a few weeks as he was on vacation. The worship was amazing, the sermon was inspired, and it was one of those Sundays when we partook in communion. It really set the tone for the rest of my day.

When I got to Hollywood Studios, I first grabbed a bite to eat. It wasn't much. It was a zucchini based wrap in the Star Wars land. It was pretty good. It just wasn't enough to fullfil my hunger needs. So I snagged a walk-up reservation at Mama Mel Rose's Italian Restaurant. I love that place! I went there about 3 times last year. This was my first time this year. Every time I go, I get something different. It is always great.

They sat me at the pizza bar since I was alone. It was like eating in the kitchen! It was great! I hadn't experienced that before. While there, I got out my iPad again and continued writing. This time, I worked on a different chapter than the one from the day before. In this one, I felt like I was very productive. The words just kept coming and it was all pretty good, if I do say so myself. I have to refine it a little. And there is still more to write. But I was very pleased with the progress I made with it.

After lunch, I sat at one of the park benches and just did some people watching for a bit. It was probably about an hour or so. I was taking in the sights, the sounds, the experience. I love it when I take those moments to just be in the moment. I need to do that more often. But I'm certainly glad I did it in that moment. It was fun watching everyone interacting with one other. Families enjoying their vacations. Couples enjoying time together. Grandparents having fun with their grand kids. Lovers holding hands as they were headed to their next adventure.

Next to where I was sitting was a new food booth, Hydraulics. It is a Coca-Cola inspired spot to appears to be something out of Los Angeles from yesteryear. As amazing as the place looked, the beverage I go there was less than stellar. I ended up tossing it out...hehehe This was on my way to go see my pal, Olaf!!!
