# TBD

It is well with my soul. I don't really want to describe what happened last night. But something interesting happened. A calmness and peace flooded my soul beyond any I have experienced before. I would love to always feel that way...hehehe Alas, that isn't how life works...LOL I could go into great detail about what it is I saw/experienced and how I responded to it. But I feel as though it was a moment for just my memory. I am only bringing it up in my journal to hopefully be a reminder someday that, although the sword may cut through expectation, we should remain with Him always without any doubts about His Love. *With an attitude of gratitude, let's accept what is meant for us today. And reject what isn't!* (Today's Vitamin G)
