Well, the latest storm should arrive in the next 24-30 hours. We should begin to experience some of it as early as mid-day tomorrow. But landfall will likely be in the middle of the night. Or about the time I typically go to sleep...LOL Current projections show it landing south of me. Where I am is expected to have minimal impact similar to all of the other hurricanes I've experienced here. My prayers go out for those in the path. It appears to be heading in the same path that the big one in 2022 took. This one is likely going to be less strong, though. It has been a very powerful storm in the gulf. However, there are some factors that are weakening the storm as it approaches land.

One of the things I've noticed since moving here is that the rest of the world seems to be more anxious about these storms than those who live here...LOL Part of that could be how it looks on the national and international news. They don't really do a good job talking about what these storms are and how they work. I totally get why it seems so scary to everyone else who doesn't live here. I use to live in Indiana and saw those reports. But the information we received down here in Florida paint a completely different story. There isn't a sense of panic. I personally do not follow the local news. I use an independent service that I pay a subscription for. They just give me the facts and they educate on how these weather events work. I've been able to share with my neighbors this information and it has helped them remain calm too. Of course, I preface it saying I'm no expert and I'm only sharing what I learn from the service. I also tell everyone that they need to make the decisions that work best for them and their families. I haven't told anyone they should stay home like I am. I just have a calm way about me that seems to bring comfort to others. At least that's what they tell me...LOL
