# TBD

I overslept today...HAHAHA It was weird. My alarm went off and I acknowledged it. I have to in order to turn it off. But I fell right back to sleep. And then my white noise app must have turned off on its own. But that didn't wake me up either...hehehe When I finally woke up, it was almost time to start work...LOL I suppose my body really needed that extra time! I almost never sleep that deeply...HA!

After that, I felt a little goofy; which inspired my morning post. It also inspired a few silly videos. I sent one of them to my deer friend. The funny thing about today is that in the past, oversleeping would have caused me to panic and feel rushed to get going. That wasn't at all the case today. I don't know what my favorite moment will be today. But waking up feeling peace despite having overslept is definitely a top tier moment today <3

Last night, my sister asked me if I had decided on all the places I was going to visit in California next week...hehehe I told her what I'll be doing is still evolving...LOL I guess it has been a very long time since I've taken a real trip. Have I forgotten the protocol?!? You go somewhere and you plan everything ahead of time, right!?! Nope, not me...hehehe I think most of what I'll be doing there will be spontaneous. The fact that I'm doing anywhere is exciting enough...hehehe

As of now, the only plan that seems to be coming together is a visit to [The Last Bookstore](https://www.lastbookstorela.com) in LA on Saturday. I may also visit Little Tokyo that day while I'm in the area. I don't plan on driving into LA. So I'll take transportation in. I'd like to get to Union Station as part of that adventure. Taking the trains as part of this will be something new for me. I'll be doing these things with ChÃ©rie. So it will all be amazing. Sharing these experiences will be cherished memories for the rest of my life <3

Originally, we were going to do the arboretum. Then we added another day to also go to Color Me Mine and do the farmer's market. Then it became The Last Bookstore and possibly Little Tokyo. What I love about all of these ideas is I'll have plenty of time do it all even though she isn't able to join me for everything. All are great ideas and I can choose to do some of them on my own or not at all. I love the fact that I can just let these moments happen on their own. That's going to make this vacation feel relaxing.

The trip keeps evolving as the time draws near. Partly because I now know what the weather is forecast to be. But also because of some wonderful news! She got promoted at work! Yay!!! My heart is incredibly happy for her! She seemed to feel bad about needing to reduce our time together. But I am way too excited her new opportunity to be concerned about that at all. I am so proud of her. This past year of her journey has been so inspiring. To say my heart is happy is a great understatement. Understanding her past and seeing her future bloom makes today such a blessing. I'm grateful to get to see her story unfold. And I'm grateful for the moments I get to be a part of it.
