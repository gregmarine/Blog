# TBD

Happy Monday! A new week! It's also a holiday...LOL I'm not sure which one to celebrate, though. Growing up, this was Columbus Day. I didn't know Columbus personally, but I hear he wasn't a pleasant fellow. So, someone somewhere decided this would be Indigenous Peoples' Day. I'm happy to celebrate Indigenous Peoples. But it is also Canada's Thanksgiving Day...LOL I have Canadian friends and happy to celebrate with them too!

At my new company, this is an observed holiday. But instead of just having the day off, they offer a floating holiday. That means I can either take the day off or work and use the time off on any other day I want. When I woke up today, I decided I'd just go ahead and take today as the holiday. I'll be getting two other floating holidays. So, I decided it would be nice to take today instead of waiting. I don't recall ever having today off...LOL

I ended up spending most of the day praying and reading extra scripture. I took a couple of really long walks. I also sat out in the shaded lounge area of the pool. It was a great day to pray. The weather was perfect for being outside. I'm really glad I took today off.

I don't think I ate enough food today to balance out how much activity my walking was...hehehe I may end up eating a little extra for my evening snack. We'll see. But one thing I've noticed is that I've been hungry quite a bit today. I've eaten what I normally do and the normal amount. So I really do think it has something to do with just how much walking I did.

I've enjoyed following along with the Dodgers this year. They are currently in the NLCS as they won the NLDS last week. Their season began on my birthday...hehehe I hear they are playing at Angels Stadium in March next year. I may plan a birthday trip to go see them...hehehe I really hope they win the World Series this season. Not just because I've become a fan. But also because this was the year I became a fan. It would be extra special for them to win this particular year...hehehe
