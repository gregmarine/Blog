So, I finally started working on video journaling...hehehe I made this [Silly Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/p3yoVC4sbEA) and uploaded it to YouTube to see how to add video journals without having them show up in my channel. I don't really use my channel anymore. At one time, I wanted to make videos and have a channel for fun. I never really got into it. Now, it's mostly an archive of my old stuff. Well, I didn't want to clog up the list of videos with my journals. Uploading that video helped me see how to do what I wanted. I hope I did it correct. I think I did. The links should work from here while keeping the channel clear.

I next made a real video journal entry. You can see it [here](). With it, my intention was to journal in such a way that I was able to convey how I feel through my voice and body language. I just talked. I felt that typing out how I felt wouldn't express the meaning behind it. So, I'm glad I recorded it as a video. It's raw, of course. It helped with my insecurity of being on camera. I didn't edit it in any way. It is as exactly how I recorded it...hehehe

I'm going to try do some of this in 2025 on a regular basis. But I'll also try to take my random videos of my adventures and piece them together as a journal entry on those days.
