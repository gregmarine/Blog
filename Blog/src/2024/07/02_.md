# TBD

I'm not sure how much I'll put in today's journal entry. But I wanted to write something today. Have a few things that are relevant for today...hehehe But I'm also about to go on a trip. I hope to journal each evening on the trip to catalog what I did that day and what I thought about. Part of the point of this trip is to get out of my own head and sort of do a reset to kick off the second half of this calendar year. It will also be a reflection on the first quarter of my personal year.

Today is dad's birthday! Happy Birthday Dad!!! He turned 70 today. He was born in California near the area I'm traveling to. It is somewhat serendipitous that it worked out that I'd be traveling there just after his 70th birthday...hehehe I've been in his life for the last 46 years of his life. So he would have been 23 the day I was born and turned 24 3 months later. He was so young and probably didn't know what he was doing...LOL j/k He's doing pretty well overall. I imagine he'll be around for quite sometime to come; Lord Willing, of course.
