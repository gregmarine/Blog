# Disney Christmas

Today is a doubleheader journal entry day...hehehe The other entry is a timestamp entry for my day. This one will be about my Disney Christmas yesterday. I failed to journal about Disney Thanksgiving. Which is perfectly fine. It wasn't my first time doing Disney for Thanksgiving. But this is my first Christmas at Disney. It is so special.

I went to bed *early* on Christmas Eve expecting that I'd want to get up early Christmas morning and *rope drop* Magic Kingdom. Early is relative. So, going to bed early just meant I wasn't going to stay up past midnight as I usually do. I think I was in bed by 10:30pm that night...hehehe So not that early for this timezone...LOL I think I was awake around 4am Christmas morning.

Being up that early was nice in that I didn't need to rush to get ready. I was able to do my morning routine, minus breakfast and coffee. I waited for those latter items for Disney...hehehe But I was able to do everything else at a nice pace. I was ready to walk out the door about 45 minutes before I needed to leave...hehehe

There wasn't any traffic to speak of on my way to Disney. That was to be expected. First of all, it was super early. Secondly, it was Christmas. There wouldn't have been the typical commuter traffic for those working in the Orlando area. I think it took about an hour and 45 minutes to get there using the back roads. I prefer the back roads for a few reasons. The back country of Florida is beautiful and it saves on fuel...hehehe

Arriving at Disney's Ticket and Transportation Center (TTC) so early meant I was able to get a great parking spot. It wasn't too far from security. I don't mind parking far now that I'm healthier. But I knew my day would be long and I'm glad I didn't have far to walk after such a long day...hehehe

After I made it through security, I headed over to the Joffrey's kiosk for a cup of coffee. I then headed to the fiery that goes across Seven Seas Lagoon. The wait on the boat before we set sail across the lagoon was so long that I drank the entire cup of coffee before we left the dock...LOL But that meant that I didn't need to hassle with that cup once I arrived at Magic Kingdom...hehehe

I arrived at MK shortly after 8am. Technically, I missed *rope drop*...LOL But that's okay. It was still early enough to count as at least being there about the time it opened. After I took some quick videos, I made my way to get my first set of PhotoPass pictures for the day! I enjoy doing the photos. I don't always like looking at them. I mostly do those to share with others. But it is fun to have them taken. I feel famous...LOL jk And the *magic shots* are always fun. It gives me the chance to feel *animated*...hehehe

Next, I made my way to a quick service to get some breakfast. Yeah, I'll not be doing that breakfast again. I went to *The Friar's Nook*. I had a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel with *potato barrels* (tater tots). Those were mid at best. I did enjoy the eggnog shake, though. I went there for the shake mostly. But I also had never been there before. So, I thought I'd try something new. A one and done experience for me...LOL

I wasn't sure what attraction(s) I was going to ride at MK. I started to walk around and came across Space Mountain. I realized it had been a while since I've ridden it. The wait time was 50 minutes. I didn't really have any set plans in the morning. So I decided I'd do it. I soon realized they do a special holiday edition...hehehe So I quickly became happy with the choice. I hadn't ever ridden that version.

The wait was much shorter than 50 minutes. Plus I told them I was a single rider and they sent me down a special path. I skipped about 15 minutes worth of people after having only been in line for about 20 minutes...LOL I really enjoyed the special holiday edition. It's basically Christmas lights and music. In the ride photo, I look like I'm a time travel visiting from the 1920s...LOL

After that, I did Carousel of Progress. And I tried to do some shopping. They didn't have what I was looking for, though. Before I left MK, I decided to see if the barbour shop had availability for my first haircut in about 5 years. They did and I got a trim...hehehe That was a fun experience. My last haircut was at the same place just before the pandemic shut the world down. Technically, I had another haircut after that...but it was to remove my hair so that I could shave my head...LOL

Shortly after I put my name in for the haircut, someone else came to put their name in. I was told I'd be waiting about 10 minutes. They were told it would be 20...LOL I wasn't in any hurry. So, I went to the Cast and asked them to switch our names so *Rick* could go before me...hehehe

As I continued to wait, someone came up to me to ask where the Starbucks was. I went ahead and directed them to it since I knew where it was. They thought I was Cast with my dapper attire...LOL I enjoyed being able to help them, though.

I was called for my haircut and got *Cari*. She did a great job and was a lot of fun to talk to. We did a video selfie after I was done. They don't allow tipping on credit cards and I didn't have any cash. So the Cast that took my payment told me where the ATM was. I walked over to the ATM to get some cash and then returned to the barbour shop to give Cari her tip...hehehe

That was the end of my time at MK. So I made my way over to EPCOT for my lunch reservation.
