# TBD

So, I'm trying a new (to me) soap. A little over a week ago, I bought some Zum Bar soap. I had seen that Ch√©rie had gotten some but I didn't think much about it at the time. Then when I was shopping at Sprouts one day, I came across it while I was looking for something else. I recognized it and my curiosity was peaked...hehehe I liked the scents and the ingredients looked good. Since she also trusts it, I decided to give it a try. I've been using it for just over a week now and have been quite surprised at the results. I've had issues with dry skin and scalp for about 30 or so years and have tried all sorts of soaps and shampoos. Some medicated and some just your basic *Head & Shoulders* type stuff. I've even tried various lotions and whatnot to keep my skin moisturized. Nothing too serious and no risk of cancer. Just the type of irritation that became a struggle because it just wouldn't go away. Well, within a week, every single skin irritation, rash, and dry spot on my body has cleared up. I even had this spot on my right ear that just wouldn't clear up for months no matter what I tried. Yet, within a few days of using Zum Bar, poof...all gone!

Not everything other people do is right for me. But I do pay attention to what others use to take care of themselves. Sometimes I give something a try and it doesn't work out. Sometimes, like has been the case with Zum Bar thus far, it works out rather well. I'm finding it important to not stick with *tradition* for tradition sake or to keep with the status quo. I much prefer to grow through new experiences if it seems like it might be good fit. Sometimes, *good enough* is, well, good enough. But other times, I need to break the cycle in order to grow. To some, a simple thing like changing soap might seem like something silly to celebrate. But that's just who I am. When I have faced something that has truly been a struggle, then something so simple comes along to change or eliminate the struggle, I want to celebrate it. Perhaps that is one of the things that sets me apart from the *YOLO* and *FOMO* folks? I'm not judging them or anything. In fact, I have been a *YOLO* person and have had *FOMO* most of my life...LOL But it no longer takes the big moments in life to get me excited or to find happiness. Oftentimes, it is just as simple as a bar of soap. I hope I remain this way for the rest of my life...hehehe

That reminds me of a little cloud I saw yesterday that made me happy. I was sitting outside having lunch and decided to capture the moment in a photograph. This little cloud was perfectly lined up in the middle of the frame of what I wanted to capture. Although taking photos helps me connect to fond memories, I also see it as a means by which I can express myself artistically. The little cloud being in just the right spot in just the right moment really made me happy...hehehe And it's a pleasant reminder that I'm always at just the right spot in just the right moment for God's plan for my life. I mess it up all the time. But I'm not even the point of my own story...hehehe He is the point. He is the hero. I'm the side kick. I'm the little cloud in the photograph. Just passing through the portrait of His Beauty and Love.

I was going to post something about this on social media. But I decided not to because it is difficult to put context around some things on socials. Even if I posted *something*, I still intended to journal about it...hehehe I had ordered a cookie. One that I have recently ordered a few times. But this time, she asked me which color I preferred; pink or blue. I honestly didn't have a preference and said either was fine. She replied with, *I'll go with blue because that's my favorite color!* I absolutely love interactions such as this. It is one of those moments where I see our separate journeys coming into parallel and are now forever connected. I don't know who she was or if I'll ever see her again. As far as I know, this was our first, and possibly only interaction for the entirety of our lives. But I will forever remember that *her* favorite color is *blue*.

For added context, I've been getting this particular cookie lately because my body has been craving sugar. Back in January, I finally kicked my candy addiction in the behind...hehehe I continued getting natural sugars from fruits and my daily orange juice. I still have some fruit in my diet. But as of my return from California, I have dropped my daily 7 oz of orange juice. This particular cookie is made with clean ingredients. Even the coloring doesn't use dyes. They use vegetable sourced coloring in the icing. That said, I wouldn't call this cookie healthy...LOL Clean ingredients just means my body can process what's in it. I shouldn't make this little delight a regular part of my diet...hehehe I still need to keep my sugar consumption regulated by more natural sources. This is just a fun little cheat snack that led me to find out that blue is someone's favorite color...hehehe

The seemingly simple details are important to me. And lately, I'm finding it easier and easier to recall some of the simplest of things. I suppose it helps me remain connected to the important people in my life. But I also tend to connect to the details of random folks as well. Perhaps that's just a way for my soul to stay in practice?..hehehe I think one of the reasons this has become increasingly easy for me is the whole *slowing* down thing. Since my mind isn't so busy chasing after that next big thing, it has time to observe the world around me to see what it truly is. I also feel as those journaling has freed up my mind to store some of these details. And one of the added benefits of all of this is the ability to more easily recall some lesson God has been teaching me so I can apply it to whatever circumstances I'm facing in any given moment; big or small. My life somewhat seems random on the surface. Yet, I still wonder if all of these things are connected somehow.
