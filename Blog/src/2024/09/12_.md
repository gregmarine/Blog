## 9:00am

I've been logged into work for about 45 minutes. I haven't been able to get much done yet because there is an outage with the client's Microsoft apps...hehehe I log into two separate systems. One of them is working fine. I'm not sure if I've explain this yet, but the company I use to work for is now my client through my new company. The Microsoft apps that aren't working are those used by the client...aka, my old company. My new/current company's Microsoft apps are working fine. It seems it might be a routing issue between the client and Microsoft as opposed to some major outage. I imagine it is affecting other customers as well. Just not all. I heard Microsoft posted on Twitter that they are investigating an issue. Best of luck to all involved!

I haven't had coffee in a few days. I think I'll make some and have it today, though. And I'll make some toast. I need to work on a more well balanced diet. I'd like to go back to having eggs in the morning. It has been quite some time since I've done that. During my health journey last year and at the start of this year, I'd continue having hard boiled eggs. But I stopped having eggs for breakfast. Before this journey, I'd have them often. One of the many things I use to be known for were my big breakfasts...hehehe I would post a photo of what I made along with my Vitamin G. When I stopped eating breakfast, I would only post a photo of the sunrise...hehehe

As you can see by the start of this entry, I decided to give a timestamp entry a try today. We'll see if I stick with it and post it later. Of course, if you are reading this, I did follow through and post it...LOL

## 10:00am

Well, I've had my toast and I'm almost finished with my coffee...hehehe Also, at around 9:15am, the Microsoft app issue was resolved. Back in business at work...LOL I remember a day when outages like this couldn't happen. Apps were installed locally on your computer and ran independently from the Internet. You would send files instead of having them in the cloud. However, what we do today isn't unlike what it was like before personal computers existed. Long before I began my career, computers were extremely expensive. Apps didn't reside on the computer at all. There were mainframes that you would log into from a dummy terminal that was remotely connected through a network. So, it is very similar to how things work today. The exception for today is that a lot of the computer processing is done locally and then sent over the network to servers for storage. Servers do some of the processing. But they are mostly the dummy side of the equation now.

I'm feeling so much better today. A true answer to prayer! Between poor sleeping and unbalanced eating lately, my body was like *whoa there Greg!* LOL But today it feel so much better...hehehe I'm considering looking into a dietitian. I was thinking that perhaps I need someone to help me design a more balanced diet for my specific needs. I've been listening to my body and that has gone well since the beginning of 2023. But what if I can do better? There is still a lot I simply do not know about my body. I can listen to it all I want. But I don't always understand it...hehehe

I'm drinking from my Goofy dad jokes mug today. It reminded me of how I use to post dad jokes a lot. I've changed so much over these last several months since my health journey began. Again, health being the three major groups of mental, spiritual, and physical. I've naturally changed how I engage with people and social media. I don't look at this as a bad thing. I'm simply being who I am. As I change, so does what people see come out of me. Sometimes I feel like going back to posting things like my dad jokes. And when I feel inspired to do so, I will. But there is no formula or algorithm to *Greg*. I haven't even been posting Vitamin G much lately. I just haven't been that inspired...hehehe I think that's okay. It isn't a reflection on how I'm doing. Because, I'm doing really well overall <3

## 11:40am

I have found myself at Zen again today...LOL It's as if I'm addicted to coming here...hehehe I always feel good after eating here. I trust the chef and where he likely sources his ingredients. I don't actually know his sources...hehehe But I have a good feeling about it.

I just had a meeting about another part of the client's business they are selling off. This part of their business is being transitioned a bit more aggressively than the part of the business I was part of. The timelines are so much tighter. They just began the process and it is scheduled to end before the transition I'm currently in...LOL I use to have tasks with this other part of the business. But I really don't anymore. I was invited to the meeting because all of IT was called in on it.

I made a social media post today...hehehe I kept it simple and how I felt. I'm feeling really well today. So that's all I said...LOL Treating social media more like a mini journal seems more like how I want to engage socially. I've even thought about posting little snippets from this journal on days I write. I've actually done that before a few times.

I almost posted a dad joke. I may still do that later. Today's coffee mug put me in that mood. I looked up some of the ones I use to post. I don't actually have any new jokes...LOL Although I'm technically a father still, my dad duties have come to an end.

## 12:40pm

I finally got around to posting some of my Duke Gardens photos on Instagram...LOL It has been like three or four weeks since I was there. That was such a lovely day. It was also the day of the pop up rain storm. It was like being in Florida...hehehe One thing I noticed in my photos from the day is I took very few of the flowers. The few flowers I tried to capture really didn't turn out. The average person may like the flower photos I took. But my Instagram is for me to express and communicate my heart...hehehe If I'm not feeling the photo, I won't post.

A little bit ago, I decided I would focus more on my photography with Instagram. That was the main reason I joined that platform years ago anyway. I still post Vitamin G when I'm inspired to post those. But any photography specific posts will only be on Instagram. I still post photos on other platforms. But the photos aren't the point on those posts. On Instagram, I'm telling part of my story as seen through my lens <3
